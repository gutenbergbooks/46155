<h2 id="c1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>In this book we are going to introduce something new
and interesting to many, the weird cactus plant life of the
Southwestern desert&mdash;strange and marvelous growths which
we call the Fantastic Clan; and to increase the reality and
charm of the subject we will take an imaginary trip into the
domain of the flowers of the desert. We shall explain here
how to come to know them, and how to grow them in gardens;
and we hope that, after reading, you will desire to have
a cactus garden of your own, for the desert cacti are so different
and so beautiful, with their symmetry of filigree and
lacework, their fantastic shapes and marvelous colorings,
and in many cases with a perfection of design that seems to
have just come from the draughting board. We will not
attempt to picture <i>all</i> the wondrous beauty of the Night
Blooming Cereus, nor to tell how dainty the Arizona Rainbow
and the California Pincushion really are. We will try,
however, to treat in large measure about them, and about
all the most important groups of cacti known to man, here
in Mexico and our own Southwest, the great cactus area of
the earth. We will show where they live and how they live,
and in what manner they grow; and when you actually see
them, in traveling across the Great American Desert, you
will appreciate the wondrous beauty of desert creations and
the flashes of brilliant color, gorgeous beyond description.
No artist can paint nor pen describe the weird Fantastic
Clan, as they are glimpsed peering out from under the rocks
or gathered in clusters and patches surrounded with their
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
dead-looking, drab-colored neighbors; or rearing their stately
heads far above the ordinary walks of life in columnar pillars
of towering strength. There is a fascination away out there
on the desert; nevertheless, unlike the strange weird members
of the cactus clan, we come not to stay, but only to enjoy
the charm of the desert, to study and learn, and then to
depart on our way.</p>
<p>Without help from the following persons and organizations,
it would have been impossible for us to make such
careful study of these plants, so widely distributed over the
Southwestern deserts:</p>
<p>We thank Dr. James Greenlief Brown and Dr. Rubert
Burley Streets of the University of Arizona for numerous
photographs; Professor Andrew Alexander Nichol of the
University of Arizona for rare species of cacti collected;
Dr. Forrest Shreve of the Carnegie Institution of Washington
for specimens of plants and photographs; Evelyn Thornber
for pen-and-ink drawings of cacti; Miss Frances Hamilton,
Mr. William Palmer Stockwell, Mr. Frank Henry
Parker, and Mr. Barnard Hendricks for assistance in making
careful studies of the cacti; the University of Arizona and
the Desert Botanical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution
for help in procuring specimens of cacti for comparative
study.</p>
<p>We are deeply indebted to Mrs. John Wilmot Estill of
Los Angeles, California, for her exquisite paintings used
in this book.</p>

<h2 id="c2">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>We believe that many readers are interested in the
mysterious plants and flowers of the desert, especially of
the great Southwest. Here in our own back yard, as it
were, in sunny California and also over in that great sand
pile of southwestern Arizona, sometimes called the &ldquo;Studio
of the Gods,&rdquo; time has carved and chiseled out wonderful
valleys and ca&ntilde;ons, and graced their floors with tiny streams
of water like threads of molten silver on burnished sands.
This desert fairyland is brimful of Nature&rsquo;s most curious
plants and flowers. Here in Nature&rsquo;s workshop you will
find plants and flowers weird and marvelous, of fantastic
shapes and grotesque design, of glowing hue and exotic
fragrance.</p>
<p>Out where rock and sand and gravel, and sagebrush and
mesquite and chaparral struggle hard to hold on to life, the
giant cactus, Sahuaro, the Old Man cactus known as <i>Cereus
senilis</i>, the Prickly Pear Opuntia, and the wonderful Night
Blooming Cereus live on peacefully and quietly and seem to
smile down on man and beast and reptile, in the magnificent
splendor of their brilliant flowers and fruit in the spring.
Drought or rain in plenty seems to make but little difference
to most of these, for the reason that Nature, the Great Engineer,
has given these plants a unique structure which enables
them to store up enough moisture in their reservoir systems
to last, in some cases, as long as <i>three years</i>, if the rains
should not come. It would tax man&rsquo;s ingenuity to the utmost
to beat that!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_x">[x]</div>
<p>Do you know how the Cursed Cholla gets its name? or
why the cactus spines are such a puzzle to the botanist? or
the romance Time has woven round the Night Blooming
Cereus? or why the Barrel cactus is the Indian&rsquo;s friend in time
of drought, the traveler&rsquo;s friend when lost? or why the Fishhook
cactus is called by that name? Would you know a
Pipe Organ cactus if you saw one? Do you know that the
Strawberry cactus or Hedgehog is delicious for food?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fantastic Clan&rdquo; tells you about all these things. In
this book we take you on a pleasant journey through a wonderland
of plant life, stopping at lonely isolated spots to
view the Night Blooming Cereus cactus, whose ethereal
beauty vies with the famous orchids of the South American
forests. And to see this lovely queen in all her pristine
beauty will make you forget the orchid and the rose! We
also get a glimpse of the Hawaiian Night Blooming Cereus,
so exquisitely beautiful that, for ages, in faraway Hawaii
magnificent fiestas have marked the opening of the buds and
the blooming of the Night Blooming Cereus.</p>
<p>Then we take you into the presence of the giant cactus,
Sahuaro, which in a previous volume we have called the Sage
of the desert; steadfast, towering pillarlike fifty feet into
the air, he gives a sense of power to all who behold him, some
certain realization of the grandeur and the mystery of God&rsquo;s
creations here on Earth.</p>
<p>The Serpent cacti, with their grotesque angular arms projecting
like so many sinuous tentacles, claim our attention
next; and the Prickly Pears, advance guard for the entire
cactus clan, pass before our gaze. Many, many others, of
fantastic shapes and distorted growth, freaks of nature,
also numbers of God&rsquo;s glorious creations, flowers of ethereal
beauty, trees, majestic and noble, crowd into this picture
stretched before our eyes in one vast scene of limitless sand,
the Great American Desert.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_1">[1]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER I
<br />A DESERT FASHION SHOW</h2>
<p>Kipling once said, &ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve heard the East a-calling,
you won&rsquo;t have anything else.&rdquo; And this is true of the
desert. The charm of the desert, once it gets its hold on
you, always brings you back. There are no fears nor dreads
out there; it is the place where mankind can go and rest.</p>
<p>When springtime comes it is time to be on the move, to
see new places, new things, to enjoy, to learn. Early in
April we start on a trek or trip by automobile across the Giant
Amphitheater of the Sun, somewhere on the great desert
along the Mexico-California frontier and thence on into
Southern California; seeking out the plants and flowers which
appear now in gay spring tints and hues, scrutinizing their
wondrous beauty, their colorings and fantastic shapes, their
scientific make-up and their dwelling places, and occasionally
their grotesque appearance.</p>
<p>The desert is an enormous caldron of burning sand, rolling
and rising and sinking here and there. But in the spring
these arid lands present a striking parade of beautiful flowers&mdash;a
veritable fashion show! It is early in the morning of
a cloudless April day; the night dew is on most of the blossoms,
and they are fresh from its bath. There is no dust
and their colors are still bright as we inhale the fragrant
scent. The desert glow is brightening, for the sun is rising
just over the eastern rim of the foothills, and we stop to gaze
upon the first of a colony of cacti called the Cereus Group.
The name Cereus is musical; we find that it is from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Latin, meaning torch, and is given to this genus in the family
of Cactace&aelig; because of the beautiful candelabralike branching
of some of its members.</p>
<h3>GROWTH AND HABITATS</h3>
<p>They are trees, shrubs, or climbers, growing erect or
spreading out with ribbed branches; they are the tallest and
largest of the Cactace&aelig;. The flowers are funnel-form,
some are elongated and very showy, and we find that they
bloom mostly in the darkness of the desert night. Perhaps
this night blooming accounts for the softness and brilliance
of their delicate colorings, as of the orchids, the most
gorgeous of which as you know come from the deep shaded
forests of the South American jungles. The genus Cereus is
very large, comprising more than two hundred varieties.
Their native habitats are in South America, Central America,
the West Indies, Mexico, and southern United States.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Caterpillar Cactus</span> (<i>Cereus eruca</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Lower California, Magdalena Island</i></p>
<p>The first of these growths to attract our attention is the
weird Creeping Devil cactus! How apropos is this nomenclature!
We see it here in Lower California, <i>Cereus eruca</i>,
creeping along the coastal lands and over the fine drifted
sands of the seashore like countless thousands of caterpillars
crawling over the ground, worming their way slowly across
the sandy plains to the sea. This remarkable cactus grows
on the coastal plains of Lower California and is abundant on
Magdalena Island in very sandy soil, preferring the softer
sand for its habitat and particularly the wind-drifted material,
over small areas of which it forms a more or less continuous
covering, broken here and there by dead stems. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the clumps of this cactus the desert foxes live; for in its
natural habitat it prevents the sand from drifting and offers
homes for the little animals of the region.</p>
<p>The stems lie flat on the ground with their tips somewhat
upturned, thus resembling huge caterpillars, head and body;
they grow along on the ground, rooting from their lower
surfaces, elongating at the tips, and dying back behind,
which results in a slow forward movement of the whole
plant. When this cactus meets with a log or stone the stem
with its upraised tip gradually grows over this hindrance,
up one side and down the other, and by the dying back of
the rear end, in time passes over the obstruction. The
stems, varying from three to nine feet in length and nearly
as large as a man&rsquo;s arm, are very spiny, with fifteen to
twenty radial and central thorns of a dark brownish hue
and dull tan, turning to grayish white with age, the tips
translucent yellow. The flowers are bright yellow, the
fruit delicious and relished by Indians and Mexicans both
as a salad and as a preserve.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Senita</span> (<i>Cereus Schottii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Lower California, Sonora, and Southwestern Arizona</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p004-1.jpg" alt="SENITA, ZINA, OR SINA (Cereus Schottii)" width="435" height="780" />
<p class="center"><span class="small">SENITA, ZINA, OR SINA (<i>Cereus Schottii</i>)</span></p>
</div>
<p>The next growth to attract our notice is that called by
botanists <i>Cereus Schottii</i> or <i>Lophocereus Schottii</i>. It is
named also for convenience Senita, Zina, and Sina. This is
a remarkable cactus found in Sonora (a state of Northern
Mexico), southwestern Arizona, and Lower California under
the most arid conditions. It grows commonly in colonies
and patches in the mountain ca&ntilde;ons and there enjoys protection
that the individual plants do not have. The young
plants are equipped with silvery, short, stout spines, and the
old ones with slender, long, flexible bristles, grayish or purplish
gray, giving the appearance of old age&mdash;hence the
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
common popular name of Senita. At a little distance these
bristlelike thorns appear like fine purplish bands, from their
symmetrically twisted spiral arrangement on the five- to
twenty-foot yellow-green stems, which are supported by
wooden cores or scalloped cylinders. Senita plants are very
striking on the arid mountain slopes, along the foothills, and
in protected valleys and ca&ntilde;ons where the winter is warm
and the summer hot, their dense branches often interlocking
in huge clumps twenty feet across and twenty-five feet
high. Their bristly stems resemble somewhat a squirrel&rsquo;s
tail or bottle brush, and in Mexico the plants are grown
for fences which are unique and effective. The flowers are
about an inch and a half long and as wide, shaped like a bell,
with very lovely cream-white and pale pink petals shading
into deep pink at the tips. The fruit is a greenish brown
changing to dull red when mature, and globose. The blossoms
and fruit of this species are rather small for the
Cereus; the flowers open in the evening and close in the
morning, and while delicate are not at all showy.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Prohibition Cactus</span> (<i>Cereus Emoryi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Lower California, Northern Mexico, and Southwestern California</i></p>
<p><i>Bergorocactus Emoryi</i>, as he is sometimes called, is a little
fellow to have such a long name. He is odd and rather
humble, and very much resembles the Hedgehog Cactus, another
group of Cereus, entirely. He grows well on the arid
hillsides near the southern coast in San Diego County, California,
and in Lower California; perhaps we should call him
the &ldquo;Prohibition cactus,&rdquo; for he likes his home place dry. A
foot or two high, he grows in thick impenetrable masses ten
to twenty feet across, and covered with a dense spiny coating;
fifteen to thirty slender, yellowish, needlelike but stiff
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
thorns, half an inch to an inch long or longer; pale yellowish
brown flowers, quite small and clustering toward the tips of
the stems. As we stop a moment here in Lower California
to view him, we see that he is somewhat interesting, but
though a member of the noble tribe of Cereus not attractive
to us as a weird cactus, having little to suggest the dignity
and grandeur of the giant Sahuaro, the uniqueness of the
Pipe Organ with its finest of fruit, or the exquisite blossoms
of <i>la Reina de Noche</i>, queen among desert flowers.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Old Man Cactus</span> (<i>Cereus senilis</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Mexico</i></p>
<p>Next in line of our fashion parade comes the <i>Cereus senilis</i>,
sometimes called by the botanists <i>Cephalocereus senilis</i> (a
polite way of saying &ldquo;old man&rdquo;). For a long time he has
been one of the most popular of the Cactus Clan. He grows
well in cactus gardens and conservatories, here and in
Europe, and is greatly in demand on both continents; his
habitat is the limestone foothills and mountains in northern
and central Mexico, and is rather inaccessible. We find that
the radial spines of the young plants are transformed into
coarse white translucent hairs from four to twelve inches
long, and, being deflexed like long gray hairs, suggest the
name of &ldquo;Old Man Cactus.&rdquo; In the varying conditions and
locations where he grows, he is sometimes called the
&ldquo;Bunny&rdquo; or the &ldquo;White Persian Cat&rdquo; cactus. All the spines
are fragile and break easily, and hence the Old Man cactus
should not be handled more than is necessary. In maturity he
grows around his head a dense mass of tawny wool, sometimes
longer on one side suggesting a hat cocked to left or
right, which gives the tall plant a most grotesque and rakish
appearance. This cactus is columnar and little branched; in
some instances he grows to a height of forty-five feet, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
is a very imposing sight in the landscape. The stems and
branches are pale green or yellow-green with a scurfy waxy
coating over the surface, are not tough, and sometimes a
large tree can be cut down with a small pocketknife! The
rose-colored flowers are bell-shaped or funnel-shaped and
night-blooming, appearing only on the older plants. The
inch-long fruit is rose-colored and covered with scales and
tufts of hair or short wool! How strangely at times Nature
does her work!</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Pipe Organ Cactus</span> (<i>Cereus Thurberi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Lower California, Sonora, and Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>An aristocrat of the Cactace&aelig; claims our attention next,
<i>Cereus Thurberi</i>, called also the &ldquo;Pipe Organ&rdquo; cactus. It
grows well in the arid mountain regions, on the lower mountains
and flats of Lower California and from Sonora in
Mexico to southern Arizona, usually in colonies, seeking the
rocky, gravelly soil in foothills and along the mountain
ca&ntilde;ons. Notice how it branches near the base and grows
from ten to twenty feet tall; very erect and stately, the plant
makes quite an appearance in green armor with a thin waxy
coat. Surrounded by smaller patches of cacti where it
towers well over them all, <i>Thurberi</i> presents a very striking
picture in this setting of old Mexico or Lower California.
We note that its great columns of yellow-green cuticle look
much like the pipes of a giant organ silhouetted against the
sky away out on the desert; hence the name Pipe Organ
cactus or Pitahaya. We might even fancy that the rush of
the wind through mountain and ca&ntilde;on, with its piercing
shriek or duller roar, the song of the desert, is music emanating
from the giant pipes of this great Organ cactus of Arizona
and Lower California. The flowers, like those of many
others of its kind, bloom in the night and are usually closed
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
by nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning; growing in the tops of
clusters of slender spreading grayish spines, lining the fifteen
or twenty ridges of the stems, and, it is to be noted, appearing
only on the tips of the stems; beautiful blooms three
inches long with white margins, the delicate petals light pink
with green and white bands along their edges, the innermost
petals satiny white with some pink above, gradually toning
into the purple-red of the sepals. The fruit of &ldquo;Pitahaya
dulce&rdquo; as the Indians call the plant, globose, olive-green, with
a crimson sweet fleshy pulp when ripe, is a rare delicacy and is
highly prized by Indians and Mexicans for the making of
jellies and jams, conserves, syrups, and sweetmeats. From
the syrup they also make wine.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Serpent Cactus</span> (<i>Cereus serpentinus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Mexico</i></p>
<p>In one of the cultivated gardens of Northern Mexico we
are introduced by the hospitable natives (half Mexican, half
Spanish), to that weird and striking growth, the <i>Cereus
serpentinus</i>, known also in the realm of botany as <i>Nyctocereus
serpentinus</i>. Any one of its long sinuous tentacles,
the six to fifteen entangled stems, might easily remind one of
the twisted body of a serpent springing at its intended victim!
This is a Night Blooming Cereus cactus, supposed to
be a native of eastern Mexico, where it grows half wild in
hedges and over walls, but its habitat is uncertain. The
stems, eight to fifteen feet long, grow erect for about ten
feet, and then bend over or are pendent for several feet; on
top of the ridges running along them are clusters of slender
spreading cream-white and reddish brown spines, flexible
and not stiff like those of most cacti.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">

<p class="center"><span class="small">NIGHT BLOOMING CEREUS; GODDESS OF THE NIGHT; LA REINA DE NOCHE; THE QUEEN OF NIGHT (<i>Cereus Greggii</i>)</span></p>
</div>
<p class="bq">You must come to the desert in the soft shadows of the moonlit night to
see the ethereal beauty of this rare and exquisite flower. For only one night
in each year does the flower queen come forth into bloom, scenting the warm
sweet air of the desert land for miles and miles, while thousands of people,
Indian and white, gather for the brilliant spectacle of hundreds of thousands
of waxy white blossoms. Then no more may the eye of man behold the
lovely colorings, nor sense the exotic perfume of the Goddess of the Night,
until her appointed time comes yet again in the Desert Land of Plants and
Flowers.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="center"><span class="small">SAHUARO OR GIANT CACTUS (<i>Cereus giganteus</i>); AND PALO VERDE</span></p>
</div>
<p class="bq">The noble &ldquo;Sage of the Desert,&rdquo; towering fifty feet into the air,
oldest and largest of the American Cacti, often attaining the age of
two hundred and fifty years, entwining with the Palo Verde.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Why are such names as <i>la Reina de Noche</i> (the Queen of
Night), Mexican Night Blooming Cereus, <i>Junco Espinoso</i>,
given to this Cereus? We see the answer in the large bloom
nearly a foot long and over <i>seven</i> inches wide, of a delicate
tan-pink in background, shading into the soft cream-white of
the petals, then the corona of stamens, a symphony of pale
yellow and white; touches of green grace the bases of the
sepals, and the whole forms a lovely picture against the
background of old adobe dwellings, evanescent and brilliant
in the white rays of the southern moon. And the fragrance
of this lovely Cereus! The perfume from a single blossom
will fill a large room or a whole yard: a pronounced spicy
odor somewhat like that of a tuberose. This beautiful
flower resembles that of the <i>Cereus Greggii</i>, our own Night
Blooming Cereus. Its delicate colorings and poignancy of
perfume make it one of the finest blossoms of the flower
kingdom, much in demand for cactus gardens and window
decoration. The showy beauties are highly prized by Mexicans
and Spaniards as well, both in Mexico and abroad.
Strictly night-blooming, and opening but one night in a
season, the beautiful blossoms begin to unfold soon after
sundown, having increased rapidly in size the day before,
the loosened sepals and petals giving the flower the appearance
of an inverted flask; the blossoms close soon after sunrise
unless the day is cloudy, when they remain open until late
afternoon. This blossoming, however, continues on different
plants during April, May, and even into June. With
favorable conditions the weird serpent plants run wild and
grow luxuriantly, forming very striking hedges; and they
are most attractive as climbers over the Mexican adobe walls.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Giant Cactus</span> (<i>Cereus giganteus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California, Southern Arizona, and Mexico</i></p>
<p>That fellow over yonder is <i>Cereus giganteus</i>, or <i>Carnegiea
gigantea</i>; he is &ldquo;old Sahuaro&rdquo; (pronounced &ldquo;sa-w&aacute;h-ro&rdquo;),
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Saguaro, or Giant cactus. Sahuaro is the &ldquo;Sage of the
Desert&rdquo; because of the great age he attains, often two hundred
fifty years or more. He is the giant tree of the cactus
clan. There are Sahuaro out on the Great American Desert
that were old when the thirteen colonies became a nation in
1776. Proud and dignified and stately they stand out there
in the great alone, silent sentinels of a long gone past still
hardy in the towering strength of their great age, with
yesterday gone forever and looking to the day that is yet
to come.</p>
<p>Near sunset we may fancy them in silent meditation as if
determining some mooted question of time or weather. For
in case of long continued drought the reservoir systems of
these great trees store up enough moisture to last them for
three years, and they will blossom and fruit just the same
without fail and on time! Over the entire length of these
giants, run long ridges or flutings, which serve the plants as
miraculous reservoirs for water: as the ridges expand, the
plant becomes water-filled; and as the great tree uses up its
moisture, these flutings contract into proper position, thereby
exhibiting but one of the many marvels in engineering consummated
by Nature, the Great Engineer. Along his twenty
or twenty-five flutings she has given Sahuaro a formidable
array of long sharp spikes which defy the approach of man
and beast alike: grayish black spines, clustering on the lower
ridges of the plant and never bearing flowers, and clusters
of yellowish thorns, on the upper part of stem and branches,
that bear the blossoms and fruit.</p>
<p>Thirty to fifty feet tall, these sentinels of the desert tower
above the baby Pincushion, the Cholla, the Creosote and
Desert Sagebrush, and the other Cerei, which seem but tiny
dwarfs in comparison. Columns of their massive trunks
grow singly for a distance of ten to fifteen feet, then curve
abruptly erect in candelabralike branches, terminating in
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
masses of waxy white blossoms, the whole giving strongly
the effect of a lighted candelabra in the dazzling sunlight.
Full-grown Sahuaro weigh six tons or more; they are very
sturdily constructed, vigorous and hardy, caring not for wind
or weather or time. Woodpeckers make their homes in
the waxy green trunks of old Sahuaro, and the injuries made
by birds are sealed over by a coating of tissue from the plant
itself. These coverings often take form of water containers
and are so used by the Indians. The spiked armor causes
Sahuaro to be feared by man and bird and beast, and the
bold woodpecker and the hawk are almost alone in venturing
to nest in their trunks.</p>
<p>In flower time the blossoms are produced in abundance on
the tips of stem and branches, large satiny blooms four inches
or so long and half as wide, growing solitary but in such great
masses of waxy white bloom as to give the effect of being
clustered; as usual with the Cereus, remaining open all night
and closing in the forenoon. The Department of Commerce
at Washington is taking steps to develop the fruit of
the <i>giganteus</i> as an article of commerce. Shaped like an egg
and about the same size, its crimson red pulp is made into
wine by native Indians and Mexicans, preserved as jam and
fruit in clay ollas, and after drying in the sun served as
delicious sweetmeats to the whites trading near by. In
June, when the sun is blazing hot, the Papago Indians camp
in forests and harvest the fruit of old Sahuaro, while the dead
plants furnish material for the building of their huts and
adobe dwellings, the &ldquo;ribs&rdquo; used for rafters and poles, and
even for fuel. The ceilings of many old buildings in Tucson,
Arizona, were made of Giant cactus ribs, several layers deep.
Many an Indian life has been saved by old Sahuaro in time
of severe drought. Is it any wonder that the Papago begins
his New Year in June with the fruiting of the Giant cactus?</p>
<p>The beautiful blossom of the Sage of the Desert is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
state flower of Arizona. A hundred miles west of Tucson,
Arizona, is a great forest of these noble cacti, the Papago
Sahuaro Forest of Arizona, while another forest of the great
trees is a little to the east of the state capital, Phoenix. The
Giant cactus thrives best in the rocky valleys and foothills
along the low mountain slopes and ca&ntilde;ons, and prefers a
southern exposure. He likes a sandy, rocky soil where the
roots can go down deep, or run long distances underground.
He begins his life under the protection of some other plant
or shrub, and in time crowds out even his protectors. Near
Victorville in Southern California, in northern Mexico, and
through all of southern Arizona, &ldquo;constellations&rdquo; of huge
massive Sahuaro, viewed by the traveler for the first time
in the ghostly light of the moon, are a sight never to be forgotten.
Like apparitions they seem in the white rays,
strange and noble figures of another world appearing before
us in these fantastic desert plants; it is as if a graveyard had
suddenly delivered its dead! Silent and mute and still they
stand; waiting and watching and never seeming to die. And
here we must leave these majestic plants to their heritage
of the desert, above whose blazing sands they tower serene
and untouched by the life struggle silently going on around
them.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Night Blooming Cereus</span> (<i>Cereus Greggii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California, Mexico, Southern Arizona, and Texas</i></p>
<p>The fashion show of the desert is about to close, for we
see approaching us in southeastern California the <i>Cereus
Greggii</i>, the typical night blooming cereus. Have you been
in the Hawaiian Islands? Have you attended any of the
early Spanish fiestas? Have you heard the stories of the
Night Blooming Cereus? If so, you have heard about the
most beautiful, the most fragrant of flowers! No flower garden
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
or conservatory is complete without this graceful queen
of the desert, whose evanescent beauty surpasses the orchid
and the rose; for the delicate shadings and exquisite colorings
of the South American orchid are no finer than those of
this night blooming cactus. Pen or brush in the hand of the
genius scarce can do justice to the loveliness of Nature&rsquo;s
handiwork, the Goddess of the Night. Most popular of all
the cacti, she delights to grow wild on the desert mesas, where
the sensuous spicy fragrance of her beautiful blossoms perfumes
the air for miles around, along the <i>bajadas</i> in western
Texas and Southern California, over the mesas of southern
Arizona and far down into old Mexico. Never in abundance,
this rare flower grows in twos and threes under a
creosote, cat&rsquo;s-claw, or other desert shrub, which affords the
flower goddess protection from the hot desert winds that
at times sweep over the mesas and down the ca&ntilde;ons, and
from the blazing heat of the noonday sun. She prefers a
deep sandy loam along the swales or draws of the desert, at
altitudes of twenty-five hundred feet and more, though sometimes
she appears on the mountains as far up as forty-five
hundred feet; and related varieties, <i>Cereus pentagonus</i> and
<i>Deeringii</i>, even grace the plains at sea level in the swampy
lands of Lake Okechobee down in the south of Florida. Another
cousin, the <i>Cereus undatus</i>, grows wild all over the
tropics, and is a great favorite among natives and whites in
Honolulu; around Punahou College there, in Punahou
Valley, the hedge of this Night Blooming Cereus is a half-mile
long, and on a single night five thousand blossoms have
unfolded! This bloom, often twelve inches long, is the best
known of all the Night Blooming Cereus flowers.</p>
<p>Two to eight feet in height, the blackish green angular
grotesque stems bearing the lovely flower queen, almost like
a crooked stick or dead snake in their fantastic appearance,
form a strange contrast to the ethereal beauty and fragrance
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of her blossoms. Often mistaken for a dead stick, these
loosely branched and densely fine hairy stems of the <i>Cereus
Greggii</i> are rarely noticed on the desert; but we who are
fortunate enough to have a guide can perceive that the thin
half-inch base of the trunk is narrower here than a few
inches higher up, almost like the slim neck of a snake. Each
slender trunk consists of a central woody core one-fourth inch
in diameter, covered by a series of furrows to draw up the
moisture which is stored in the fleshy beetlike root, weighing
fifty to a hundred pounds and buried deep in the ground
where it forms a reservoir of water and food lasting for
more than two years. Thus, rain or shine, the delicate
flower goddess may bring forth her lovely blossoms at their
appointed time. Then too, Nature has provided her favorite
with finely barbed, stout stiff hairy spines, about one-eighth
inch long, growing on the areola so as to resemble
a small insect of the desert.</p>
<p>The flowers are from seven to ten inches long and about
six inches across, with a delightfully spicy fragrance, which
at times is quite strong. The colorings of the <i>Greggii</i> are
a wondrous harmony of tint and hue. The background of
color forms a corona of waxy white and rich creamy yellow
that looks as if it had been chiseled out of a rare old marble,
with no duplicate in all the world; shading beautifully into
the white of the petals, with their hint of pale lavender diffused
throughout with touches of tan and pink; sepals and
petals recurving into a graceful cornucopia.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that Indians and Mexicans revere their
lovely &ldquo;Queen of Night,&rdquo; <i>Reina de Noche</i>, or that, across
the sea in Honolulu, a grand celebration marks the opening
of the blossoms of the Hawaiian variety, which occurs but
once a year! During Queen Liliuokalani&rsquo;s reign many were
the ceremonies to Pau on occasions of the flowering of the
Night Blooming Cereus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>You must come to the desert in the soft shadows of the
moonlit night to see the ethereal beauty of this rare and exquisite
flower. For only one night in each year does the
<i>Cereus Greggii</i> come forth into bloom, scenting the warm
sweet air of the desert land for miles and miles with poignant
fragrance. When the shadows begin to lengthen and the
deepening glow of sunset approaches, the satiny blossoms
begin to open (having already loosened and expanded); in
an hour or so they are fully opened, and as one stands watching
them curiously one can actually see them moving and lifting
from minute to minute, the petals seeming to tremble, so
forcibly is Nature causing them to expand. One can detect
the lovely fragrance as soon as the blooms start to unfold.
During the night thousands of people, Indian and white,
gather for the brilliant spectacle of hundreds of thousands of
waxy white blossoms; others celebrate in the popular fiestas
of the Southwest in old Mexico, or the luaus of far-away
Hawaii. At sunrise of the day following, or shortly thereafter,
the goddess flowers begin to fold, and by nine or ten
o&rsquo;clock on a cloudless morning they are entirely closed. No
more may the eye of man behold the lovely colorings, nor
sense the exquisite perfume of the Goddess of the Night, until
her appointed time comes yet again in the Desert Land of
Plants and Flowers.</p>
<p class="tb">And now the parade of the Desert&rsquo;s Fashion Show is over
and night is closing in. But if you wish to see the real show
and to appreciate the real beauties of the desert land in
flower-time, you must go into the silent sandy wastes when the
sun is gone and the moon is coming over the mountains,
spreading its gossamer silvery sheen over the floor of the
desert in crazy shadow-patch, and watch the blossoms come
slowly open, one by one, to receive the kiss of the night dew
and the gentle caress of the newborn breeze. For you have
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
not looked upon matchless beauty nor sensed the sweetest
perfume, till you have been out there in the great alone,
where Beauty comes and fades and dies, and is born again
in the ceaseless tide of God&rsquo;s evolution of men and things,
in the great Eternity of Being.</p>
<h3>HOW TO GROW CACTI</h3>
<p>In general cacti like warm or hot sunny southern exposures;
they grow best in sandy, gravelly, or rocky loam
or clay soils, according to the habits of the species; they succeed
best with good drainage, a moderate or limited rainfall
or a limited amount of moisture in the soil. They should
have occasional dry periods to harmonize growth with their
original desert habitats, and also all the summer heat possible.
This produces the contracted growth characteristic
of cacti with all their desert beauty and symmetry of colors
and arrangement of spines, and their fine large showy flowers.
Cacti do best in regions of limited rainfall and maximum
sunshine, blazing-hot summers, and mild winters where
the temperatures keep well above zero.</p>
<p>The bad effects of heavy rainfall can be overcome largely
by including in the soil a large proportion of sand or gravel
or cobblestones and by growing the plants on ridges or raised
borders. The effects of fog and extreme humidity can be
corrected somewhat by growing them in dry conservatories.
Where the temperatures fall below the lowest temperatures
given in the section on &ldquo;How to Grow&rdquo; for each species,
cacti must be grown in warm greenhouses in winter and
preferably throughout the year&mdash;with the exception of the
hedgehog cacti, which rarely grow successfully in greenhouses.
With the specific information given under the heading
&ldquo;How to Grow&rdquo; for each species, it is possible to grow
cacti successfully in the tropics and over a large part of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
temperate zone. The important things are: warm sunshine,
protection from too low temperatures, the right kind of
soil, and limited watering or irrigation.</p>
<h3>LOCATIONS FOR CULTIVATION</h3>
<p>Cacti may be grown out of doors in the entire southwestern
section of the United States, in Mexico, Central
America, and South America (except the southern part),
where the temperatures are never colder than fifteen to
twenty-five degrees below freezing. Also, they can be grown
successfully out of doors in parts of Spain and Portugal, and
in the region immediately bordering the Mediterranean Sea,
over much of Africa lying at the lower altitudes, in Arabia,
Persia, India, southern China, extreme southern Japan, and
the northern half of Australia, in addition to the islands of
the Pacific, nearly all of which lie between the 33&deg; parallels,
north and south (except where the temperatures are modified
by mountains or other natural features).</p>
<p>They can be grown indoors generally in the north and
south temperate zones between the 34&deg; and 54&deg; parallels,
north and south, where the temperatures reach as low as
twenty to thirty degrees below zero. This includes the northern
two-thirds of the United States, the lower half of the
Dominion of Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, France, Germany,
Austria, the northern half of the Chinese Republic,
Japan, and the southern part of South America.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Cereus Group or Torch Flower Cacti</span> (<i>Cereus</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how they grow</h4>
<p>Many species of this group can be identified by the beautiful
candelabralike branching of the plants. They are trees,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
shrubs, or climbers, and grow erect or spread out, the tallest
and largest trees or plants of the cactus family. They are
the &ldquo;torch flower&rdquo; cacti, are tropical or subtropical, the
stems growing single or clustered, with prominent ridges or
flutes which in many instances expand or contract as the plant
fills with water or loses its moisture. The tubercles are not
conspicuous and grow in rows on the ridges. There are no
leaves nor spicules. The spines are of one or two kinds,
sharp and dangerous in some species, inconspicuous in others,
growing from one-fourth inch to <i>twelve</i> inches in length.
The flowers are funnel-form, of brilliant or delicate colorings,
large and showy, and unlike many cactus blossoms are
fragrant, often with a pronounced spicy odor. In some instances
they crown the candelabralike branches in a becoming
aureola of light, giving the effect of a lighted candelabrum;
hence the designation &ldquo;torch flower&rdquo; cacti. Most
species bloom only at night. As a rule the calyx tube is found
to be very long. The fruit is usually quite large, has shallow
tubercles, and is covered with many scales, but is rarely
spiny.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Only a few of the different kinds of the Cereus Group
grow well from cuttings, including <i>Cereus serpentinus</i>. Set
the cuttings of such plants as this Serpent Cactus a few inches
deep in moist sandy soil and irrigate sufficiently to keep the
soil moist. The cuttings grow best in part shade. Cereus
plants grow readily from seeds sown in sandy loam mixed
with a small amount of pulverized charcoal and some leaf
mold; plant in pots or flats one-fourth inch to one inch deep in
the soil in partial shade, and keep the soil moist. The young
plants can be transplanted to pots when one-half inch to one
inch tall. They grow indoors or out; a southern exposure is
preferable, being warmer and more sunny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Caterpillar Cactus; Creeping Devil Cactus; Chirinola</span> (<i>Cereus eruca</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named &ldquo;eruca,&rdquo; or &ldquo;caterpillar cactus,&rdquo; because the stems turn upward at their tips, resembling a caterpillar, head and body)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The prostrate stems, three to nine feet long, lie flat on the
ground with their tips upturned, resembling huge caterpillars.
They grow in light sandy soils or sand, and root from below,
the tips of the stems elongating and growing forward, the
bases of the stems dying; thus the plant slowly moves
forward over the sand. These prostrate stems, two or
three inches in diameter, are very spiny, with fifteen radial
and four central spines clustering an inch or so apart on the
twelve to seventeen ridges which run lengthwise on the stems.
These fierce, sharp thorns are dark brown and dull tan and
turn white with age; the tips are translucent yellow. The
radials are less than an inch long and flattened, the centrals
grow to two inches in length, one very stout and strongly
flattened, resembling a dagger and with a white body. The
large flowers are bright yellow and grow four or five inches
in length, narrow and funnel-shaped, about two inches across.
The fruit is very spiny; but the thorns fall away at maturity,
and it becomes quite edible and is relished by Indians and
Mexicans.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plant in sand or sandy soil, preferably fine sand, with the
tips slightly upward, and keep the sand lightly moist. The
plant requires a hot, sunny location and will grow out of
doors in the Southwest where the temperatures do not drop
more than a few degrees below freezing, and in hot dry
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
conservatories and greenhouses where the temperatures
drop lower.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Senita, Zina, or Sina</span> (<i>Cereus Schottii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from its appearance of old age, and for F. A. Schott, a botanical explorer of western United States)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>These plants grow in colonies or patches in the mountain
ca&ntilde;ons, twenty to fifty stems in a clump, the dense branches
interlocking in huge clusters twenty-five feet high and twenty
feet or more across. The yellow-green stems are scalloped
and cylindric, five or six inches in diameter, growing four to
twenty feet or more in height, with five to nine ridges running
lengthwise from top to bottom. On these ridges cluster
the spines, silvery stout thorns about one-fourth inch long on
the young plants; the older spines are really dense bristles,
slender, flexible, symmetrically twisted, appearing like fine
purplish gray bands, one and one-half to three inches long,
and giving the appearance of old age. The flowers are
shaped like a bell an inch and a half long and about as broad,
pale pink and cream-white petals shading into deep pink at
their tips, opening only at night. The fruit is globose, an
inch or more in diameter, of a deep reddish tinge, and fleshy.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants may be grown from seed in sandy soil in flats or
pots; young plants may be transplanted in spring in sandy,
gravelly, or rocky soil. Water during dry weather enough
to moisten the soil well. The plants can be grown out of
doors only where the coldest winter temperatures are but a
few degrees below freezing. In other parts of the country,
grow in hot, dry conservatories or greenhouses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Prohibition Cactus</span> (<i>Cereus Emoryi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Emory, who was in charge of the Mexican Boundary Survey)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>This is a low-branched plant a foot or two high, growing
prostrate with erect branches in thick impenetrable masses
ten to twenty feet across. Numerous stiff, needlelike thorns
form a dense spiny yellowish coating over the entire mass.
There are many pale yellow to yellow-brown flowers an inch
and a half long which cluster near the tips of the stems.
The fruit is globose and densely spiny, an inch or so in
diameter. The plant is not attractive nor very cereus-like.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This species can be transplanted in the spring by digging
rooted stems, planting in gravelly clay soil, and irrigating
sufficiently to moisten the soil in dry periods; or by digging
a shallow hole and partly covering the stems with soil kept
moist but not wet. The plants will grow out of doors and
endure only a few degrees of frost; where the temperature
drops more than fifteen degrees below freezing they must
be protected outside, or grown indoors or in a warm, sunny
greenhouse.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Old Man Cactus; White Persian Cat Cactus; Bunny Cactus</span> (<i>Cereus senilis</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from the long white hairs or beards found on young plants)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>This cactus is columnar, and some mature plants reach a
height of forty-five feet. It is native to Mexico and not
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
easily accessible. The trunk is usually unbranched, cylindrical
in young plants, two or three inches in diameter,
yellow-green with a scurfy waxy coating; and it is not tough.
A large tree can be cut down with a small pocketknife in
some instances. The twenty or twenty-five radial spines are
changed over into long coarse white hairs, four to twelve
inches long or even longer, and form a dense covering; hence
the common and specific names, Old Man Cactus and <i>senilis</i>.
These radials are crooked, flattened, and twisted, while the
one to four central thorns are easily pulled out, all spines
very fragile. In maturity a dense mass of tawny wool appears
around the head of the plant. The rose-colored blossoms
are two inches long, shaped like a bell or funnel, and
appear only on the older cacti. They open at night and
close in the early morning. The fruit is about the size of
a large strawberry; it, too, is rose-colored and covered with
scales and tufts of wool.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants may be grown from seed in flats or pots, but the
seed is rare and difficult to get. Commonly young plants are
purchased and grown in pots in gravelly, sandy limestone soil.
Water sufficiently to keep the soil slightly moist. A bright
sunny location is best. The plants are tender to frost and
thrive best in warm conservatories or greenhouses. The
Old Man Cactus is a popular plant for rock gardens and is
found in many homes both in this country and abroad.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Pipe Organ Cactus; Pitahaya</span> (<i>Cereus Thurberi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of George Thurber, botanist of the Mexican Boundary Commission)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>These are large, columnar, symmetrical plants ten to
twenty feet tall; the large columns of yellow-green stems,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
in six to thirty branches ascending from near the base, look
much like the pipes of a great organ at a distance. The
stems are from six inches to nearly two feet in diameter and
are cylindrical, with fifteen to nineteen ridges lined with
clusters of slender, spreading, grayish spines. The flowers,
which appear only at the tips of the stems, are three inches
long and half as wide, and open always at night; their
delicate pink petals are suffused with green and banded in
white or green, and their purple sepals are tinged with red.
The fruit is very delicious, sweet and juicy, olive-green,
globular, with scarlet fleshy pulp. The Pipe Organ Cactus
is shown on the cover of this book. It is one of the finest
of the Cactus Clan.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Sow seed in sandy soil in pots or flats with partial shade;
young plants may be transplanted in spring or early summer
in rocky or gravelly soil and watered during dry spells
once a month to moisten the soil well. The plants can be
grown out of doors in the Southwest where the lowest winter
temperatures are only a few degrees below freezing. In
other parts of the country they may be grown indoors in rock
gardens or in warm sunny conservatories.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Serpent Cactus; Mexican Night Blooming Cereus; Reina de Noche</span> (<i>Cereus serpentinus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named specifically from the snakelike stems)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The six to fifteen entangled stems of this weird cactus
resemble a serpent. They are eight to fifteen feet tall,
about an inch in diameter, generally growing erect for about
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
ten feet, then bending over and climbing for several feet.
Each bears a dozen or so low ridges lined with clusters of
slender spines a half-inch or so long, translucent white or
dull cream color. The large brilliant blooms are eight to
nine inches long and when fully open five to seven inches
across, with soft cream-white petals and pink and tan sepals
touched with green, both strongly reflexed. The strong
spicy fragrance is much like that of a tuberose. Each plant
blooms at night and only one night in the year. The different
plants blossom from April into June. The plants
run wild in Mexico and form a luxuriant growth; they are
prized as rare beauties by the Mexicans and Indians.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Set cuttings about a foot long in moist soil, and water
weekly; or lay the stems down and cover with moist sand or
soil. When grown outside in sunny exposures but in the
protection of dwellings the plants are not injured by twenty
degrees of frost. In colder weather than this they may be
grown in warm, sunny conservatories.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Giant Cactus or Sahuaro; Sage of the Desert</span> (<i>Cereus giganteus</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>These are majestic trees thirty to fifty feet tall, with
columnar massive trunks which grow singly ten to fifteen
feet, then curve sharply erect in branches like a giant candelabrum.
Twenty to twenty-five ridges run the entire length
of the trunk, and these flutings expand as the plant fills with
water and contract as it loses its moisture. They are covered
with long sharp spikes which stick out like diminutive
swords closely packed along the tops of the ridges. The
flowers are night blooming, four or five inches long and
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
half as wide, growing solitary but in such masses as to appear
clustered, with large satiny, waxy white petals strongly
reflexed. The fruit is about the shape and size of an egg,
with crimson pulp, palatable and prized highly by the Indians.
The Giant Cactus is one of the largest cacti in the
world and can blossom and bear fruit for three years without
rain, using the reservoir of water that Nature provides.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>The plants grow readily from seed sown in sandy soil in
pots or flats and may be transplanted when a half-inch tall.
The soil should be kept moist but never wet. Transplant
young plants one to six feet high in spring, taking two feet
of the roots with care not to injure them, and set in gravelly
clay soil, irrigating once a month during dry seasons. Giant
cactus plants one foot tall or taller thrive out of doors and
will endure a temperature twenty degrees below freezing
without injury. Where the weather is colder than this they
must be protected in winter, or grown in dry sunny conservatories
or indoor rock gardens.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Night Blooming Cereus; Reina de Noche; Queen of Night</span> (<i>Cereus Greggii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. J. Gregg, student of cacti and plant explorer of Northern Mexico)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>One of the most beautiful of all cactus flowers. The
plants grow two to three feet tall, rarely eight feet, the
blackish grotesque stems densely fine hairy and loosely
branched, resembling a crooked stick or a snake. They are
very slender, a half-inch or so in diameter, and are fluted
with four to six blackish gray-green ridges, lined with spines
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
less than a fourth-inch long. The latter are arranged in
such manner as to resemble a small insect, and have thick
bulbous bases. Each slender trunk is supported by a central
woody core. There is a fleshy root a foot or so below the
ground, weighing fifty to a hundred pounds, which acts as a
reservoir for water and food, so that the <i>Greggii</i> blossoms
every year, rain or no rain. The flowers are from seven to
ten inches long and about six inches across, showing a beautiful
combination of coloring, a background of soft waxy white
shading into pale lavender in the forty or more petals, with
touches of pink and tan in the sepals, forming into a cornucopia.
The stamens form a corona extending beyond the
petals. The fragrance is delightfully spicy, strong, and
persistent; the plants blossom only one night each year, generally
in the latter part of June. This most beautiful of all
the cacti in our Southwest usually grows in the lee of a
creosote or other desert shrub in sandy loam.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Grow plants from seed in pots or flats, in sandy loam with
partial shade, or transplant without injuring the large fleshy
root, setting the top of the root about a foot below the
surface in loamy soil in the protection of shrubs; mature
plants will blossom within two years of transplanting.
Water well during the growing season, in dry weather about
once a month. Do not cultivate. Plants grow out of doors
or indoors and will endure a temperature of twenty-five degrees
below freezing without injury. In localities where
the winter weather is colder than this the plants must be
protected or grown under glass.</p>

<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER II
<br />CACTUS SPINES AND PECULIARITIES</h2>
<p>And now we will pause in our trip across Cactus Land to
take up the many peculiar features which characterize and
differentiate these odd desert plants, and to tell of those individual
and unique growths, the terrible swordlike thorns
of the strange Fantastic Clan.</p>
<h3>PECULIARITIES</h3>
<p>Cacti are not closely related to any other family of plants,
and there is no certainty as to which group of plants they developed
from. Their immediate ancestors perhaps have disappeared
in the hazy past. They stand, therefore, alone.
In this respect few other plants resemble them; only one
or two other families, for instance the Ocotillos or Fouquieriace&aelig;,
are in a like position.</p>
<p>Cacti are generally thought of as limited to North and
South America and the outlying islands. However, about
eleven species of one genus, Rhipsalis, grow, apparently native,
in South Africa, Madagascar, and Ceylon, though these
are identical with the same species growing in South America.
There is a strong belief that these species were distributed
in Africa by birds eating their ripe fruit in South America
and then flying across the ocean to Africa, and there dropping
the seeds, which germinated and grew into plants on
another continent. The most widely distributed of the various
groups of cacti is the prickly pear group of the genus
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
Opuntia. The prickly pears grow wild from Argentina
through Central America, Mexico, and the United States to
British Columbia, within four or five hundred miles of the
Arctic Circle. Prickly pears may be regarded as the advance
guard of the cactus invasion of the United States from
Mexico, and there are nearly as many kinds in our country
as in Mexico. Prickly pears are most abundant in the temperate
zones; the species grow larger in tropical parts than in
cooler temperate regions.</p>
<p>All told, there are more than twelve hundred species or
kinds of cacti, of which about two hundred twenty-five occur
in the United States and the rest in Mexico, Central America,
South America and outlying islands. Of the two hundred
twenty-five species occurring in the United States, about one
hundred are native of Arizona, the premier cactus state, and
nearly two hundred grow in the four southwestern states,
California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, with a few
in Nevada and Utah. Arizona contains almost one-tenth
of the cacti of the entire earth. Our four southwestern
states together with Mexico constitute the great cactus area
of the world, not alone in numbers but in variety and weirdness
of types, containing many of the most peculiar and
fantastic forms of these grotesque plants.</p>
<p>Doubtless because the cacti are such odd, weird, fantastic
growths, they have been popular with mankind since the
earliest times. To-day forty or fifty species are known only
in cultivation; and they have been under culture so long that
their native habitats and original distribution have been forgotten,
and are no longer known. This is due largely to the
fact that several very popular species have been dug up and
removed from their own haunts to cultivated lands, or
planted in gardens to such an extent that the last specimens
have been taken and they no longer grow wild or under natural
conditions. This uprooting is taking place continuously,
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
doubtless much faster now than formerly, and in future we
shall have many additional instances to record, as it is quite
likely that new species are originating under experimentation
through careful selection and ingenious plant breeding.</p>

</div>
<p class="bq">A new and handsome little strawberry cactus, named in honor of Frances Bonker for her writings depicting the beauty and
charm of the desert land.</p>
<h3>SPINES AND FLOWERS</h3>
<p>The spines of cacti are ever an interesting subject for
study, and the very name &ldquo;cactus&rdquo; is suggestive of thorns.
It is generally known that cactus spines develop from their
bases and that they are impregnated with resin or a resinlike
substance, while the spines of nearly all other plants (as for
instance the plum) grow from their tips and are not resinous
in character. A young growing cactus spine has a very soft
yielding base while the tip is hard and sharp, and the sides
retrorsely barbed. Because of their resinous nature the
thorns persist on the desert long after the cactus body has
disappeared, and often fragments of the thick cuticle remain
with them, still firm, sharp and translucent. Such spines
about a spot where a noble Sahuaro or Giant Cactus has
fallen and gone back to Nature as dust may persist for a long
period unchanged, without crumbling or otherwise disintegrating;
this is true also of those of the bisnaga or barrel
cactus. Thorns grow on the Giant Cacti for a hundred,
even two hundred years, unalterable, sharp and hard and
dangerous. Some species of cactus have as many as three
kinds of spines: centrals, the inner thorns, usually the largest
and stoutest; radials, the outer spines; and what are termed
&ldquo;bristles&rdquo; but are more accurately described as &ldquo;antennalike&rdquo;
spines. In some groups, as the bisnaga, the spines are cross-ridged
or marked transversely, with the tips smooth, straight,
or hooked. Many cactus spines are marked with brilliant
colorings, and some are transversely banded with bright
variegated &ldquo;zones&rdquo; of color. When held to the light they
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
are translucent and show beautiful colorings: red, orange,
yellow, brown, and purple. Generally cactus spines are
glabrous, that is, smooth and without hairs, but the spines
of some cacti are densely fine-hairy or distinctly hairy; and
this can be seen easily with a pocket lens or the unaided eye:
their pubescence commonly produces a grayish layer overlying
the true color of the spines beneath. The thorns of
Cholla differ from those of other cacti in that they are
covered with sheaths which can be removed very easily,
and then are not replaced. The significance of these sheaths
is not clear, except that they help form a barrier against the
intense heat of the sun and the burning desert sands.</p>
<p>We find, too, that the cacti with most pronounced thorny
growth live in the hottest parts of the desert, where the
thermometer often registers 130&deg; Fahrenheit during the long
summer days and sometimes up to 150&deg;! Their dense layer
of spines becomes a shield of lacework, protecting the plants
by cutting off over twenty per cent of the light, and reducing
the terrible heat by raising the humidity within the network
of spines, which in turn reduces evaporation from the plant.
If it were not for their thorns and sheaths cacti would be
scalded by the burning temperatures of even one summer
day in the great desert amphitheater of the sun. Being
resinous, cactus thorns are very inflammable, and if ignited
they all burn to a cinder before the fire ceases, for one cluster
of spines will set others aflame and so the fire sweeps over
the entire plant, rapidly changing the beautifully colored,
symmetrical and translucent spines into ugly charred masses.</p>
<p>The cactus is encased in a thick cuticle which is continuous
over the whole surface of the plant, except at the numerous,
small, rounded or oval areas of growth called areolas. In
the cactus all growth, of leaves, spines, spicules, flowers, and
even roots (in the case of cuttings) and branches, takes place
from these areolas, which are truly areas or centers of
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
growth; and if all these areolas are cut away on the stem and
its tip cut off, the plant ceases to grow and dies. Spines are
generally understood to represent branches, since they grow
from the tissues of the plant under the epidermis and not
from the epidermis. The inordinate multiplication of
spines in cacti is not well understood by botanists. Some
cacti add thorns to their spine clusters in the areolas each
year, and thus in time the cluster may come to have as many
as fifty or even a hundred spines on old stems and large
branches. Occasionally cactus spines replace themselves in
areolas after the former thorns have been destroyed or
burned off. The thorns of some cacti may grow as long as
six inches and even longer, and as broad as one-fourth inch at
their bases. After they complete their growth toward the
close of the season and the bases become hard and firm, they
do not elongate farther nor make further growth.</p>
<p>The flowers of cacti are generally large and showy and
are quite responsive to light in their opening and closing.
They have many stamens, from thirty or fifty to as many
as three thousand in the Giant Cactus. This development
of stamens is rare among flowering plants, and is due to a
splitting process that takes place early in the development of
the stamens of the embryo flower. The stamens of many
cacti are sensitive to touch and when being worked by insects
for pollen are constantly moving backward and forward.
Cactus flowers differ also from nearly all other flowers in the
number of sepals and petals, which is variable and relatively
large, and in the fact that their sepals and petals are not
distinct in character. Rather there is a gradual transition
between the bracts of the ovary, if such are present, and the
sepals; and likewise a gradual gradation in form, color, and
size between the sepals and petals. There are usually several
whorls or circles of petals in the flower; commonly such
flowers are spoken of as being double.</p>

<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER III
<br />THE BABY CACTUS</h2>
<p>Out in the vast desert land in ages long gone by, the stifling
sun had burned everything to a cinder. This seeming annihilation
was but part of that great plan wherein the desert
regions of the earth have been transformed into the greatest
flower garden of all creation; where Time has chiseled out
the filigree of lacework and pattern for the hills and valleys;
where erosion has painted the beautiful pictures on
the faces of mountains and hills; where volcanic action has
juggled the rocks and mountain sides into fantastic shapes
and designs, piling them up and leveling them out again for
ages untold, until the Divine decree was accomplished. For
God has walked amidst all this seeming turbulence, and with
infinite patience has brought forth verdure and flowers the
like of which do not exist anywhere else on earth; and to-day
when Man ventures into the great arid wastes it would seem
that he little anticipates the hidden loveliness to be found
there&mdash;the wonder of desert creations, flowers and then more
flowers, blossoms of rare and seductive beauty, of exotic
and sensuous fragrance. Flowers that cannot be painted
by brush or in coloring to do justice to the delicate waxlike
originals. Flowers that seem like delicate souls wrapped
in somber lifeless bodies, trying to gain expression through
their beautiful colorings and evanescent perfume in the dry
atmosphere of their monotonous existence, out in the great
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
stillness of the arid spaces with only the midnight blue of
the heavens to caress them, and the dew of the night zephyrs
to kiss them when the torrid sun has gone.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of a fine April day near Needles,
California, on the Arizona border, we continue our journey
into the desert. Before us stretches a panorama the like of
which few among us have ever beheld; a picture majestic, tremendous,
suggestive of the grandeur of Nature&rsquo;s workshop,
the vastness of those great sweeps of arid lands, covered with
symmetrical, cross-patch, lacework, fantastic growths, of
every size and shape and color imaginable. The Cholla are
there, Giant Sahuaro rear their great trunks high into the
air, and fantastic Joshua Trees lean toward us, their weird
grotesque arms with long grasping fingers all pointing in one
direction as if to guide the weary traveler on his way. And
peering forth from among rocks, in the lee of a Giant Sahuaro
or growing in a forest of the grotesque Joshua whose fantastic
arms seem to engulf these tiny cacti, we find the Baby Pincushion,
our Mammillaria (Coryphantha) or <i>Cactus Mammillaria</i>.
He is a funny little ball-like plant, two or three
inches in diameter, full of star-shaped spines, with an extra-long
one in each star cluster and rather hooked over on the
ends. These little aristocrats of the desert often cling together
in groups, like a colony of sea urchins, and are very
dainty when in bloom in the balmy month of April, when all
the desert life is arraying itself in gay spring color and
blossom.</p>
<p>Out on the desert mesas and along the <i>bajadas</i>, or mountain
slopes, we find so many fantastic objects that it is hard
to decide just where to start. Nature has provided many
wonderful mysterious growths for her desert land of plants
and flowers, and she has been careful to place them where they
will be able to thrive and to evolve. Many will be found hidden
away under rocks and in deep ca&ntilde;on recesses; others out
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
on the foothills, where it would seem that the sun would
burn them up; still others are placed boldly on the mesas
where wind and rain and sandstorms play hide and seek
around them. Naturally the question of growth, which is
next to the most vital problem of all &ldquo;Where do they get their
moisture?&rdquo; now presents itself. We will begin at the bottom
of the ladder, to-day, and will select the Baby Pincushion,
the smallest of the cactus family.</p>
<h3>GROWTH</h3>
<p>Several natural groups or genera go to make up the Pincushion
Cacti, and of these the two most important in the
great desert of the Southwest are the interesting plants of
Coryphantha and Mammillaria. The name &ldquo;Coryphantha&rdquo;
alludes to the plant&rsquo;s habit of bearing the flowers at its top;
Mammillaria is from <i>mammilla</i>, a nipple, referring to the
tubercles or knobs of the plant. They are the smallest of the
large and important cactus family (Cactace&aelig;), the Fantastic
Clan, and their stems are single or in clusters and from one
to twelve inches in height and diameter, often as broad as
long, or broader. Often, too, the upper surface is almost
flattened, while the main part of the plant is a carrot-shaped
fleshy root, which Nature, the great Builder, has made a reservoir
of food and water for this, her baby of the Fantastic
Clan, to withstand the drying desert winds that sweep across
the mesas and up the ca&ntilde;ons, and the months of drought and
fiery heat in the desert sun, when no rains come to freshen
and beautify the earth and to gladden the hearts of native
dwellers on the desert. The stem is studded with tubercles
spirally arranged, and each crowned with an areola bearing a
cluster of slender but stout spines, often hooked like the tines
on a spear; and usually with hairs. This spiral arrangement
gives the plant a very attractive appearance. Some
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
species have a thick milky juice in their stems, others a colorless
watery sap.</p>
<p>The flowers are day-blooming, both opening and closing
with surprising rapidity. Mammillaria blossoms are relatively
small, while those of Coryphantha are much larger,
often two or three inches across; yellowish, white, pink,
rose, red, or purple. There are usually many sepals, petals,
and stamens, all beautifully and symmetrically arranged, and
the harmony of color in the flowers is often commented upon
with delight. While the flowers last at most but a few days,
many of the different plants are in bloom for a considerable
length of time, and some blossom two or three times a year
during the spring and summer. The fruit of Pincushion
Cacti are naked and smooth, rarely with a few scales in some
species, and when mature red, green, yellowish, or dull
purplish, and club-shaped or nearly globose. They are
borne at the bases of the tubercles; in Coryphantha, at the
bases of young tubercles near the top of the plant, so that
they appear terminal; in Mammillaria, at the bases of old
tubercles some distance from the top of the plant.</p>
<p>Pincushion Cacti are very popular for window gardens
and miniature cactus gardens on account of their smallness,
their symmetry and beauty, their fantastic shapes and designs,
and their bright-colored dainty flowers. They are
considered to be among the most highly developed of the
cacti, inasmuch as the greatest reduction of the plant body
has taken place, the plants having no leaves nor even trace
of leaves. In the evolution of cacti the tendency of the different
groups and species is to become leafless, and most cacti
either are without leaves or have leaflets that soon disappear.</p>
<p>Baby cacti grow readily from seed, preferably new seed,
which is Nature&rsquo;s method for their reproduction. For
this gallon tin cans or large flower pots, with holes in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
bottom for drainage, half or two-thirds filled with gravel
and sand and the remainder with light sandy soil, or wooden
flats twelve by twelve inches or larger and three inches deep,
filled to a depth of two and a half inches with fine light sandy
soil, answer well. The soil must be free from alkali, but
may contain some finely divided organic matter. Level
the surface of the soil firmly to prevent water from collecting,
sow the seed an eighth of an inch deep, cover carefully,
set in a sunny location, and give just enough water to
keep the surface moist but not wet. (Out in the open, cover
the frame with glass painted white or with white cheesecloth,
and raise the glass slightly to insure ventilation.) The seeds
should be sown in warm weather, and they should begin
growth within one to three or four weeks. After the plants
have grown a half-inch or more, transplant to two-inch pots,
using paper pots or the usual flower pot, and with the soil
somewhat heavier but drainage good. From this time their
growth is more rapid and far more interesting, and they
should be kept in a sunny location and given frequent light
waterings, and, later, less frequent but heavier waterings.
Do not attempt to force growth by heavy watering or heavy
fertilizing. Once established and having grown to a considerable
size, many of the Pincushion Cacti propagate by
means of offshoots from the axils of tubercles below the surface
of the ground, and thus form clumps of several larger
plants with numerous smaller ones about them.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Foxtail Cactus</span> (<i>Coryphantha deserti</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California, Northwestern Arizona, and Southern Nevada</i></p>
<p>The desert is noted for its many forms of mirage, and because
of the rarefied or clear atmosphere due to lack of moisture,
things are not always what they seem there. In the
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
distance ahead numberless baby foxes appear to be moving
slowly toward us, their heads and bodies hidden from view,
their white and reddish tails waving in the hot desert breezes.
Now our guide smiles, and as we drive closer and stop he
points out several clumps of short cylindric Foxtail Cacti,
covered with dense masses of stiff radiating spines, white or
whitish with darker tips, and stout central spines white at
their bases, then black, shading into reddish brown, the whole
resembling a fox&rsquo;s tail and creating a striking appearance.
Light pink are the dainty flowers, and when full open (only
in the brightest sunlight) nearly an inch and a half wide and
long, the sepals hairy and the beautiful petals narrowly lance-shaped.
It is no wonder that our baby cacti are so popular
for winter rock gardens with their almost perfect symmetry,
and their wonderful uniformity of spines so often beautifully
mottled, with exquisite patterns of color and design, brilliant,
cross-patch, symmetrical, running through the individual
thorns. Care should be taken that such rock gardens are
<i>arid</i> gardens, and that the soil is not enriched, with just
sufficient water to encourage a natural, compact, symmetrical
growth. A heavy flooding occasionally is good. If over-watered,
or fertilized too much, or if shaded, these tiny cacti
make a rapid artificial growth, usually non-symmetrical in
part, called &ldquo;storied&rdquo; or &ldquo;zoned.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Cream Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria MacDougalii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Western and Southern Arizona, and Northern Sonora</i></p>
<p>Especially is this true of the Cream Cactus, a very odd and
interesting Pincushion, with a thick conical fleshy root which
transplants easily and grows with little care from the hand
of man. This fellow is broader than he is tall, four to ten
inches in diameter, only two to six inches high, having a flat
head around which radiate his clusters of thirteen or so
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
cream-white short stout spines, and one or two pale red
central thorns with purplish brown curved tips and yellow
bulbous bases; into this harmony of color come the flowers
in bloom, twenty-five or more cream-colored or light yellow
petals recurving into a lovely cornucopia effect, very pretty
in the dazzling sun of spring and summer on the desert.
When injured by small rodents or other enemies, <i>MacDougalii</i>
yields a thick creamy fluid which immediately heals
the wounds, and is pleasant to taste. Hence his name.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Recurved Spine Pincushion</span> (<i>Coryphantha</i> or <i>Mammillaria recurvata</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona and Northern Sonora</i></p>
<p>Hidden under a crevice in the rocks along our dusty track,
we spy that little fellow, <i>Coryphantha recurvata</i>, with his
dense coat of interlocking thorns, stout but slender and often
hooked on the ends, recurving downward and inward toward
the plant body with yellow and orange-brown hooks, and
almost hiding the plants from our view. Rightly are the
Pincushion Cacti named: with their tiny compactness and
beautiful symmetry, they resemble nothing so much as an
old-fashioned pincushion, with twenty or more sharp stout
needles stuck into each brilliantly colored, soft downy
cushion. Although among the larger Pincushion Cacti, this
little fellow grows only six inches tall, more often four
inches, and is three to six inches wide, a broad and rounded
dwarf, flattened and depressed on top; often as many as fifty
of his companions, their heads occasionally peering over one
another, grow in a clump two or three feet across and half
a foot high. The blossoms with their tan and brownish
sepals and the inner petals lemon-yellow, tone into the brown
and orange-brown spines, the sharp needles of our pretty
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
pincushion; the whole producing a happy symphony in brown
and orange, so that many feel tempted to purloin this prize
and take it back to adorn conservatories at home. And
how many are transported and grown in our homes in lovely
rock gardens! For <i>recurvata</i> is much in demand for cactus
collections and is very easy to transplant. Plant him in sand
or among rocks, and let him have plenty of bright sunshine
and occasionally a little water, and he will thrive with neither
care nor trouble to any one.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Devil&rsquo;s Pincushion</span> (<i>Coryphantha</i> or <i>Mammillaria robustispina</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona, Southwestern New Mexico, and Northern Sonora</i></p>
<p>The Devil&rsquo;s Pincushion is our largest and finest, resembling
a pineapple in color and appearance, with his cone-shaped
stems three to nine inches tall and three to six inches across,
his big tubercles in spirals of thirteen or more rows, coarse
yellowish thorns, and large fruit and seeds. The dozen or
so spines in a comb-like radial arrangement from a common
center, the areola, and graduated, are not alone beautiful
and symmetrical, but provide a coat of mail for <i>robustispina</i>
protecting him against excessive light or heat and cold. It
is from this armament of stout wide-spreading thorns that
he is so aptly named &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s Pincushion.&rdquo; However,
this cactus is endowed not only with a strong set of needles,
but with lovely patterns in flower array as well: beautiful,
showy blossoms, two or three inches long and wide, of a brilliant
yellow against their reddish brown background of
thorns, coming forth in one glorious splash of color for but
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
a day, then fading away from eye of man, and no more to be
seen until another year has passed.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Slender Pincushion Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria fasciculata</i> [<i>Mammillaria Thornberi</i>])</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>The Slender Pincushion Cactus, typical native of the
desert, is commonly so called because of the tiny slender stems
an inch or less in diameter and seven or eight inches tall,
growing in dense clumps of fifty to two hundred or more
plants of all sizes; some growing from seed, some from offshoots
of the axils near their bases. Out from the dozen or
so rows of tubercles spring the white thorns with their black
tips, and the central hooked spine twisted from its bulbous
base; then the funnel-shaped pale purple and pink blossoms,
giving a decidedly pinkish cast to this whole lovely pincushion.
The bright scarlet berries, while they are odd, are pretty and
also are edible. This plant was first discovered by Lieutenant
Colonel Emory in 1846; it was never seen again until
1902, when it was rediscovered by one of the writers and
Mr. Orcutt, along the Gila River in Arizona, from which
the Gila monster is named.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Cream Pincushion Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria Johnstonii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona and Northern Sonora</i></p>
<p>This gayly decorated Pincushion we see peering over solitary
rocks and gladdening the hearts of the tired travelers
along the desert track, with his pink and white daintiness of
blossom and comb of brown and white thorns is another
&ldquo;Cream Cactus&rdquo;; for it is said many an Indian has owed his
life to the thick milk-white fluid which this unique growth
yields to those who know the secret. This fat fellow looks
like a huge coconut, with a green body, and stout thorns
curved both upward and downward. Little bells are the
flowers peeping out in a circle at the bases of the old tubercles
and laughing up at us gayly as we motor slowly along the hot
dusty road.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">SUNSET CACTUS</span> (<i>Mammillaria Grahamii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona, Western Texas, Southern California, Southern Utah, and Mexico</i></p>
<p>We have come more than two hundred miles on this second
springtime trek across the ocean of sand and sagebrush and
mesquite, with its brilliant flashes of color and fragrance,
and still the clumps of dainty pincushions attract us almost
against our will. As the sun completes his journey across the
western skies, one of the most beautiful of all Nature&rsquo;s creations
claims our attention; this pincushion has earned a
title appropriate to its lovely self, the bright pink and rose
tints of its bell-like blossoms toning into the pink glow of
the desert sunset in a circle of full open brilliant flowers,
their many brightly glowing segments spreading out like so
many iridescent rays of the setting sun. What name could
be more apropos than &ldquo;Sunset Cactus&rdquo;? With her evanescent
beauty and delicate perfume she is one of the most popular
as well as the most abundant of the Mammillaria, ranging
from Mexico through Southern California and Arizona
to southern Utah. From two to ten inches tall, only a little
more than two inches in breadth, she grows more slender than
her brothers; her twenty rows of compact tubercles are set
in a beautiful gray-green symmetrical spiral, and bear twenty
or so slender grayish white radiating spines with dark tips,
a half-inch long or less, and two central thorns sticking out
stouter than the others, their bodies pale pink and their sharp
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
tips curving upward in a transparent golden fringe of
color.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Brown Pincushion</span> (<i>Mammillaria Wilcoxii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern and Southeastern Arizona</i></p>
<p>The Brown Pincushion is one of the most attractive of
the southwestern cacti, and is a rare creation indeed. This
tiny cactus is two or three inches tall and about as broad, with
a beautiful halo of red-brown thorns covering the whole
plant, the hooked central spines and whitish radials slender,
sharp, needlelike, with pointed tips. Through these the
tiny flowers peep in two rows of thirty-five or forty bright
purple or pink petals, recurved into the pretty cornucopia
effect that we have seen so often among the clumps of Pincushions
on our way across the desert. But beware of pressing
the fingers against this dainty pincushion too hard, for if
the sharp points of the central spines get hooked into the
hand it is only with great difficulty and discomfort that one
can get free. When the first offenders are released other
spines hook into the flesh, and the plant seems to play with
the victim for some time to see just how far it can go in provoking
one so lacking in desert knowledge.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Horned Toad Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria Main&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona and Northern Sonora</i></p>
<p>This rare little cactus was found in Arizona for the first
time in 1931. Two or three inches high and nearly as broad,
he seems to be sitting up in front of us like a horned toad,
looking us over, his head flattened out in a slightly grotesque
posture, pale green tubercles in thirteen or more spiral rows
covering his flabby body, from which spring the dozen or so
white and yellow radial thorns and the hooked central spines,
also forming into a regular spiral twist. The brown and
red striped flowers, an inch or so long, are not the lovely
showy beauties of his brother baby cacti. Perhaps his easy
life in grassy lands away from hottest sun and arid habitat
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
needs not the compensation of the beauty afforded his less
fortunate brothers and sisters. Does Nature make up for
the hot aridity of the desert and the barren wastes of sand
and more sand, by brilliance of flower and wealth of fantastic
design? It would seem so, for nowhere else in the
world are to be found the weird, grotesque shapes, the flaming
splendor and fragrance of blossom, the kaleidoscopic changes
of color and pattern which are created far out on the dry
expanses, under the burning sun and during seasons of inconceivable
drought.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Snowball Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria Olivi&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>Next we see <i>Olivi&aelig;</i>, the rose-tinted Snowball Pincushion,
clad in a white coat of twenty-five or thirty radiating spines
crowded together in a comb-like arrangement pressed closely
against her body and looking like a snowball lying on the
hot sand before us; the delicate rose-colored blossoms edged
with a narrow band of white form a beautifully designed pincushion;
even the stamens are deep rose, the styles light pink
with olive-green stigmas, the fruit bright scarlet, and the
seeds black. Is it any wonder that this riot of color, a rare
desert form of the <i>Mammillaria Grahamii</i>, is also called
the Sunset Cactus?</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Green Flowered Pincushion</span> (<i>Mammillaria viridiflora</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern Arizona</i> (<i>Globe</i>)</p>
<p>The Green Flowered Pincushion would make a lovely addition
to my lady&rsquo;s bower in a window rock garden. Not a
desert species, it inhabits the higher mountain levels, often in
oak woodlands; it is a rare beauty, difficult to find. Two or
three inches in length and diameter, its stem and tiny bell-like
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
flowers are both green, the radial spines loosely interlocking
over the body of the plant, slender flexible thorns, white
or reddish brown with sharp hooked tips. It is a near cousin
to <i>Mammillaria Wilcoxii</i>.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Showy Pincushion</span> (<i>Coryphantha</i> or <i>Mammillaria aggregata</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona, Western New Mexico, and Northern Sonora</i></p>
<p>A handsome baby cactus, <i>aggregata</i> occurs usually in
clumps, is two to five inches tall and almost as broad, with
twenty or forty sharp needlelike thorns a half-inch or so long,
tan or light pink, their ends forming twisted tips of white or
reddish brown, and intermixed with fifteen or more rows of
angled tubercles which bear the spine clusters. Beware of
getting a &ldquo;retrorsely barbed&rdquo; thorn into the hand! Laceration
ensues and much difficulty in extraction, for Nature has
given these, her baby cacti, sharp and relentless protectors.
A popular fellow for rock gardens is <i>aggregata</i> on account of
his symmetrical and globose head, forming a cushion of
bright pink or rose-purple blossoms which come forth to
greet the world for but a day, then fold their dainty petals
and are no more.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Arizona Pincushion</span> (<i>Coryphantha</i> or <i>Mammillaria arizonica</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Arizona</i> (<i>Kingman</i>, <i>Phoenix</i>)</p>
<p>We have traveled over halfway across the premier cactus
state, and are approaching the mighty Grand Ca&ntilde;on of the
Colorado, that great fissure in the earth&rsquo;s surface worn by
water erosion throughout the ages. Hereabouts several new
colonies of cacti are to be seen. The Arizona Pincushion
is a conspicuous but not at all common fellow, easily recognized
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
by his abundant dark-colored spines, in fact almost
hidden by this dense growth of stout dangerous-looking
reddish brown and black thorns, borne on the tubercles and
about half an inch long. <i>Arizonica</i> is the tiniest of all the
baby cacti, scarcely more than an inch tall and just as broad;
occasionally reaching the height of two or three inches. The
flowers, clustering in groups of three and five blossoms, are
like a dainty bell, the petals and sepals narrow and lance-shaped,
occurring in attractive rose or rose-purple and tan
shades.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">California Pincushion</span> (<i>Mammillaria tetrancistera</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern and Central Arizona, Southern California, Southern Utah, and Southern Nevada</i></p>
<p>Heading southward from the Grand Ca&ntilde;on we find in the
area north of Phoenix, Arizona, a most beautiful distinctive
Pincushion which we recognize as native to California. Indeed
so abundant is it in the foothills back from Los Angeles,
on the road from Big Bear Lake and out on the Mojave
Desert, that this round cactus is known as California&rsquo;s Pincushion.
Two to twelve inches tall, about two and one-half
inches broad, it has eight rows of tubercles set in a symmetrical
spiral over the pale green body, protected by forty to
sixty delicate white radial thorns, slender as a needle, covering
the entire plant, and one to four reddish brown hooked
central spines, surrounded by a dark halo of deep purple
blossoms. Bright scarlet is the fruit, but not edible as are
the fruits of several related species.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Black Spined Pincushion</span> (<i>Mammillaria Milleri</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Arizona</i> (<i>Phoenix</i>, <i>Kingman</i>)</p>
<p>Again the sun is fading over the western rim of the foothills,
leaving a flood of glory in his wake, and we are glad
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
to sight the famous old Superstition Mountains, which are
not far from Phoenix, Arizona. We hope to find one more
baby cactus before the twilight passes into the deepening
shadows of night, for then the end of our long hot trek is at
hand. <i>Milleri</i> is a handsome fellow of mesa and foothill,
boasting rose-purple or pink flowers, a showy Pincushion, reflecting
the brightness and beauty of Nature around him,
especially the flaming rays of a gorgeous desert sunset; indeed,
he most clearly resembles our Sunset Cactus. Seldom
alone, he and his companions form in symmetrical clumps,
two to nine inches high and two or three inches across, encased
in weak slender white spines with swollen pink bases, often
curved and bent on their dozen or so spiral rows of interlocking
tubercles, the firm hooked central spines of a rich brownish
red, appearing black at a distance.</p>
<h3>HABITATS</h3>
<p>Along the highway from Lake Arrowhead in Southern
California toward Victorville and Palm Springs, out on the
Mojave Desert, southward to San Diego and old Mexico,
we may find these odd little baby cacti blossoming forth in
early spring into striking clumps of variegated bloom, dotting
the landscape far and wide&mdash;their only mission in life, to
look beautiful. For above the ordinary tourist trails as high
as five thousand feet, farther down in sandy and gravelly
places on the foothills and <i>bajadas</i> or mesa-like mountain
slopes, and along the lower levels around Los Angeles, California
Pincushions make their homes. In sunny exposures
where Nature&rsquo;s boon of rain is scarce, preferring common
sand and rock, these tiniest of the Fantastic Clan thrive best.</p>
<p>Out on the great Arizona desert the Pincushion Cacti appear
in abundance; the vast stretches contain a surprise for
the tourist and the wearied student in these bits of desert
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
growth, peering from between rocks and cobblestones or
lying in clumps in crevices of the rocks among the foothills.
All colors of the rainbow, it would seem, are woven into exquisite
patterns by Nature in her baby cacti, their brilliantly
painted flowering segments spreading out in spring array
like so many gilded rays of the spectrum and creating the
mirage of a gayly tinted rainbow, dazzling the eyes of the
traveler as he speeds along the highway across the desert.
Deep in the recesses of the Grand Ca&ntilde;on of the Colorado,
northward into southern Utah and Nevada, and southward
again around the Superstition Mountains in Arizona and the
Santa Ritas (near Tucson), these dainty cacti, when in
bloom, color the landscape far and near, on the mesas and
along the bajadas into Southern California, and far south into
old Mexico, where they come forth in dozens of flowering
varieties. And here we must leave our tiny symbols of the
Cactacea clan, for the shadows are beginning to lengthen;
the sun has finished his journey across the western heavens
and we bid farewell to our baby cacti, beautiful rainbows of
the desert, for to-morrow we continue our journey over sandy
arid lands, and travel a different way among the weird Fantastic
Clan.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Pincushion Group; Baby Cacti</span> (<i>Mammillaria</i> and <i>Coryphantha</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how they grow</h4>
<p>These are funny little ball-like plants, an inch to a foot in
diameter and height, often broader than they are tall, the
upper surface almost flattened, while the main part of the
plant is a carrot-shaped fleshy root. The stems are mostly
simple, sometimes branched; they grow singly or occasionally
in clusters, and are not ribbed but studded with numerous
tubercles spirally arranged. These are the smallest of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
Cactace&aelig;, hence called the Baby Cacti, and are full of star-shaped
spines with an extra-long one in each cluster, all
thorns hooked over on the ends. The spines are slender but
stout, mostly of two kinds and generally less than a half-inch
long, sharp and needlelike, and usually with hairs. There
are no spicules nor leaves. The flowers are small or medium-sized
and open in the forenoon, closing in the afternoon
of the same day. The fruit is rather small, is smooth and
has no tubercles, scales, nor bracts. These dainty cacti often
cling together in groups, and the symmetrical arrangement
of the flowers and spines, the brilliant harmony of colorings
in both, and the spirally arranged tubercles give the plants
a most attractive appearance.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Transplant at any season, preferably early in spring, to a
southern exposure if possible, in soil similar to that of the
native habitat of the plant, irrigate once in two or three
weeks sufficiently to keep the soil lightly moist but not wet.
Provide some shade for species growing in their native
habitats at high altitudes or in partial shade. These plants
grow easily from seed sown a quarter- to a half-inch deep in
sandy soil mixed with a small amount of ground charcoal
and leaf mold in flats or pots, kept slightly moist in part
shade. When a half-inch tall they may be transplanted to
small pots. They grow indoors and outside.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Foxtail Cactus; Desert Pincushion</span> (<i>Coryphantha deserti</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Foxtail Cactus grows as a single stem or in clumps.
The stems are cylindrical and two or three inches in diameter,
with tubercles nearly an inch long and also cylindrical. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
whole plant is covered with a dense growth of white radial
spines with dark tips, and a group of six to a dozen central
spines whitish below, and with the upper half black shading
off to a reddish brown. This gives the plant a striking appearance.
All of the spines are very stiff. The flowers are
straw-colored, about an inch and a half long, and have light
pink tips. The petals are lance-shaped and narrow.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants may be grown out of doors where the temperatures
in winter are not lower than fifteen or twenty degrees below
freezing, that is 12&deg; to 17&deg; Fahrenheit. In colder climates
than this the plants must be protected in winter or grown in
sunny, warm conservatories. They may be grown from
seed in pots in sandy soil with partial shade and with enough
watering to keep the soil moist but not wet. Transplant
larger plants in sandy or gravelly soil in bright sunny exposures
and give only occasional irrigation during dry periods.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Cream Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria MacDougalii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for Dr. D. T. MacDougal, collector of western plants and Director of the Desert Botanical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Cream Cactus grows from solitary stems or heads,
and in many instances in clusters four inches high and six
inches in diameter. The tops of the plants are flattened
with the centers depressed, or often growing level with the
ground. The older plants are much taller and broader.
The tubercles are placed spirally and are a half-inch long.
If injured they yield a white creamy fluid. There are eleven
to thirteen radial spines with one to three centrals whose
bases are yellow and bulbous. The spine body is a pale red
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
with brown or purple-brown tips. The flowers are a little
more than one inch long and one inch wide, and of cream
color to light yellow. The fruit is a deep rose-red and the
seeds are reddish purple. This plant likes the gravelly clay
loam soils best.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>These plants can be grown nearly anywhere with temperatures
no lower than twenty degrees of frost; but with
zero temperatures protection should be given, or the plants
grown in rock gardens in sunny conservatories. They grow
easily from seed in sandy or gravelly clay loam soil with
partial shade and enough irrigation to keep the soil moist.
Plants transplant readily to rocky or gravelly clay soils at
almost any season, if the thick fleshy roots are not injured in
digging. Water moderately once a month, and where convenient
set plants among rocks.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Recurved Spine Pincushion; Bent Spine Pincushion</span> (<i>Coryphantha recurvata</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>recurvata</i> from the spines, which are bent down against the plant)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Recurved Spine Pincushion grows in clumps about
three feet across, sometimes less, and has several stems four
to eight inches long, which are globose, that is, longer than
broad. These stems bear twenty-seven or so spirally arranged
rows on which appear the angled tubercles. These
rows or ridges also have the twenty-five radially grouped
spines and one light yellow or translucent grayish yellow central
spine. This arrangement of the spines forms a dense
impenetrable mass or layer over the surface of the plant.
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
The flowers are about the length of a walnut and have lemon-yellow
petals and brown sepals. The fruit is quite small
and is light yellow-green. This species differs from the
others of the group in that the flowers are borne in a circle
two or three inches in diameter about the center of the plant.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>These plants will endure twenty degrees of frost without
injury; where the winters are colder than this the plants
should be covered or grown indoors, preferably under glass.
They may be grown from seed in sandy soil or sandy loam
in pots with partial shade and with enough watering to keep
the soil moist. Field plants may be transplanted at almost
any season in gravelly or clay loam soils and given enough
water to moisten the soil during dry spells.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Devil&rsquo;s Pincushion; Pineapple Cactus</span> (<i>Coryphantha robustispina</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Pineapple Cactus is the largest of the Pincushion
cacti, with its large tubercles and coarse spines. It grows
as high as nine inches, and six inches in diameter, single or
several stems in clumps. They form in hemispherical
mounds as wide as eighteen inches, with the larger stems
suggesting a pineapple. The spines are straight and stout
and slightly curved, and grow in groups of eleven to fifteen,
one of which, a central, is a little longer than the rest;
erect, and of a dull straw color fading to yellow-tan. The
bases of the spines are bulbous. The flowers, about two
inches long, are yellow or straw-colored or yellow-brown
and are very showy, remaining open all day. The fruit is
large, about two inches, and narrow or oblong and of a
yellow-green with large light brown seeds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants will endure twenty degrees of frost without injury;
where the winters are colder than this, protection must be
given or the plants must be grown under glass. They grow
readily from seed in sandy or clay loam in pots or flats, with
just enough water to keep the soil moist, not wet. Large
plants transplant with difficulty; the roots should not be injured
in digging, and the plants should be set in gravelly clay
and watered occasionally during dry spells.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Slender Pincushion Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria fasciculata</i>&mdash;<i>Mammillaria Thornberi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>fasciculata</i> from its habit of growing in clumps; <i>Thornberi</i> in honor of one of the authors of this book, who rediscovered it)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Slender Pincushion Cactus grows in the form of slender
stems in dense clusters of fifty to two hundred plants of
many sizes, all crowded closely together. The stems are
four to seven inches tall, and an inch or so in diameter. They
seem to be thickened a bit in the middle and taper off toward
the bases and tips. The tubercles are arranged in eight to
twelve spiral rows, all less than a quarter of an inch long,
and somewhat four-angled in shape. The flowers are an
inch or more wide and as long, with the inner petals broad
and acute and of a purplish pink color. The fruit is club-shaped,
a half-inch or so in length, and of a scarlet hue.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This Pincushion is difficult to transplant. Plant in partial
shade or in the protection of shrubs in very sandy soil.
Water frequently to keep the soil barely moist. It is best
set in clumps as it grew in the field. The plants will endure
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
twenty to twenty-five degrees of frost without injury; with
colder winters they must be protected or grown under glass
or in conservatories.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Cream Pincushion Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria Johnstonii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for Ivan M. Johnston who collected the plant in Sonora)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Cream Pincushion Cactus grows from solitary stems
having several thick roots, which, however, are not deeply
implanted. In outline the stems are hemispherical or depressed
globose and have a deep green color. There are
many angular tubercles, all spirally arranged, and as many as
thirteen white radial spines with brown tips. The central
spines are about a half-inch long and red-brown; one is directed
upward, and the other downward. The flowers are
bell-shaped and are formed in a circle about the center of the
head, having white margins and pink or pink-tan centers.
Like <i>Mammillaria MacDougalii</i>, the tubercles when injured
exude a thick white milky fluid.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants may be grown out of doors where temperatures are
not lower than twenty or twenty-five degrees below freezing;
where the winter weather is colder than this, the plants
should be grown in conservatories. They grow from seed
in clay loam in pots with enough water to keep the soil moist,
preferably with part shade. Large plants transplant quite
readily if the roots are not injured. They grow well in
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
gravelly soil or among rocks and should be watered once a
month.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Sunset Cactus; Common Pincushion Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria Grahamii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Colonel J. D. Graham of the United States Corps of Topographical Engineers)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Sunset Cactus, or Common Pincushion Cactus, is
one of the most popular of the Pincushion Cactus species, perhaps
because of its wide range from Texas to California and
into old Mexico. It is quite symmetrical and small. It
grows as a stem from two to ten inches tall and as much as
two and one-half or three inches in diameter, in single stems
or several together in a clump. They are cylindrical or
globose and bear the tubercles closely set in a spiral arrangement
of twenty to twenty-three rows; these tubercles are
about a quarter-inch long and gray-green. There are about
seventeen grouped radial spines a half-inch or so long, of a
dull white with darker tips, and one or two central spines
which are longer and stouter, whitish, with purple-brown or
red-brown tips which are curved sharply upward. The flowers
are formed in a circle near the tops of the stems and are
about an inch long. The petals are rose-pink with pink or
white margins, while the sepals are purple-brown with pink
or white ciliate edges. The fruit is club-shaped and scarlet,
about an inch long.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>These plants are not injured by temperatures of twenty
or twenty-five degrees below freezing, and where the winter
temperatures drop as low as zero they grow easily in warm,
sunny conservatories. Plants grow readily from seed in
pots or flats in moist clay loam, with part shade, and transplant
easily at any season, growing well in sandy or gravelly
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
soils with watering once or twice a month during the dry periods.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Brown Pincushion</span> (<i>Mammillaria Wilcoxii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of General Timothy A. Wilcox of the United States Army, who collected many plants in Arizona and other western states)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Brown Pincushion Cactus grows with flabby stems,
two or three inches tall with as great a diameter. It is hemispherical
or subglobose, and somewhat depressed at the top.
The tubercles are loosely set and spirally placed, narrow and
conical. There are eighteen to twenty sharp, slender, needlelike,
wide-spreading radial spines which interlock with those
of the other spine clusters; they are white with the tips a
bright reddish brown. There are two to six slender but much
stronger central spines which are spreading and erect with
the hooked ends turned in several directions. These are a
translucent red-brown throughout, which gives to the plant a
reddish brown halo over the mass of the white radials. The
light pink flowers are a little more than an inch long, and
when full open are wider than they are long. There are from
thirty-five to forty petals, narrow lance-shaped and somewhat
recurved. The fifteen or twenty white sepals form in
fringes.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>These plants will grow outside in temperatures nearly as
low as zero. With colder winter weather they should be
covered or grown in greenhouses or conservatories. Plants
grow easily from seed in fine sandy soil in pots or flats, with
part shade and with occasional watering to keep the soil
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
moist. They transplant readily in gravelly clay with watering
twice a month during dry spells, and should be set in partial
shade.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Horned Toad Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria Main&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for Mrs. F. M. Main, who first collected the plant near Nogales, Mexico)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Horned Toad Cactus grows from single stems, or several
in loose clumps and is depressed globose or hemispherical,
growing as short as two or three inches, with a diameter
of three or four inches. The tubercles are of a pale green,
arranged in thirteen spiral rows with compressed bases tapering
above and upturned. The texture of the plant is flabby
and loose. There are not many spines in this species, twelve
wide-spreading yellowish radial spines and one central which
is much stronger than the radials and somewhat twisted and
curved. The flowers are quite slender and about one inch
long, both sepals and petals pointed. The former have a
brownish center while the latter have reddish centers with
white-fringed margins. The style is much longer than the
stamens. This plant is not conspicuous because it grows
quite close to the ground and is not easily seen with its light-colored
spines.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants grow outside in twenty degrees of frost, but with
colder weather than this they must be protected or grown in
warm conservatories. They grow easily from seed in the
usual way in pots with part shade and with occasional watering
to keep the soil moist. They may be transplanted
at any season in sandy or gravelly clay, and given enough
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
water to moisten the soil well once in two or three weeks
during dry months.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Snowball Pincushion</span> (<i>Mammillaria Olivi&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>Olivi&aelig;</i> in honor of Mrs. C. R. Orcutt, who shared her husband&rsquo;s interest in these plants)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Snowball Pincushion is covered with a dense coat of
white spines, looking much like a snowball lying on the
ground. It grows on solitary stems or in some instances
in clumps, is globose, and has twenty-five to thirty-five thorns.
The plant is covered with radially placed spines about half
an inch long, translucent white and somewhat twisted. There
are four centrals in the spine groups. The flowers of this
plant resemble those of the Sunset Cactus, and are pink and
pink-rose with the margins fringed in white. They are
very showy and about an inch long. The pink flowers contrast
well with the glistening white spines, making this cactus
one of the handsomest of its kind, growing on the deserts and
foothills of southern Arizona.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>The same care and treatment is suggested as for the Sunset
Cactus.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Green Flowered Pincushion</span> (<i>Mammillaria viridiflora</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from its green flowers, which are very uncommon among cacti)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Green Flowered Pincushion Cactus grows from single
stems or in small clusters and is cylindrical or globose. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
stems are two to four inches long and as much as three
inches in diameter. This plant, also, has a flabby texture,
with the tubercles arranged in eight to twelve spiral rows,
which are disposed rather loosely. The radial spines, slender
and needlelike and wide-spreading, loosely interlocking
with those of the other spine clusters, are white with brown
tips. The central spines are hooked and slender, longer
and stouter than the radials, about two inches in length,
brown and brown-red. The flowers are not at all showy
and are less than an inch long and wide; the sepals and petals
are green. The fruit is ovoid and less than an inch long,
with a dull purplish or green-purple color.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants will endure outdoor temperatures of twenty or
twenty-five degrees below freezing. In colder climates they
will thrive in warm, sunny conservatories. Plants grow
readily from seed in sandy loam with occasional watering and
part shade. Transplant older plants in gravelly clay with
enough water to keep the soil moist. Watering once in two
weeks during droughty spells is sufficient. This cactus is
very attractive as a potted plant, and outside should be
given some shade.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Showy Pincushion Cactus</span> (<i>Coryphantha aggregata</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from the plant&rsquo;s habit of growing in clumps)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>This plant is a fine and showy Pincushion cactus growing
from single stems or in clumps, six to fifteen inches in diameter
across the top of the clump, the stems globose or cylindrical,
two to four inches in diameter. The tubercles are
arranged spirally in fifteen to seventeen rows, with twenty
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
to forty radially placed spines in two series like the teeth of
a comb. They are less than a half-inch long. There are
six central spines in the more mature plants, and all the spines
are of a translucent white, toning into the reddish brown tips.
The flowers are very showy and are formed around the center
of the plant, two or three inches in diameter and bright pink
to rose-purple. They remain open all day, and are quite
abundant in southeastern Arizona and New Mexico on
prairie lands and <i>bajadas</i>.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants grow outside and are not injured by temperatures
as low as zero. They grow easily from seed in sandy or clay
loam in flats or pots with some shade; transplant at any season
in almost any soil; give enough water to keep the soil
moist during dry spells, about five gallons of water at a time.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Arizona Pincushion Cactus</span> (<i>Coryphantha arizonica</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>This cactus grows in dense clumps six inches to two feet or
more across, with the heads close together. They are shortened,
globose or cylindrical, one to two inches in diameter,
and as high. The plants are almost hidden by the dense
growth of reddish brown or almost black spines. There
are from fifteen to thirty radially placed spines and three to
seven stouter central thorns, all of which have yellowish
bulbous bases, with red-brown or almost black tips. The
flowers are about an inch and a half long and as wide. The
petals and sepals are narrow and lance-shaped, and from tan-purple
to rose or rose-purple. The fruit is oval and light
green. This cactus grows in the prairie lands and on foothill
slopes, and needs a little modern irrigation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This Pincushion is not injured by temperatures of twenty
to twenty-five degrees below zero and hence is well suited for
growing in cactus gardens throughout the country. It
thrives also in the warm Southwest. Young plants grow
readily from seed in pots or flats, in sandy or loamy soil, with
enough irrigation to keep the soil moist; part shade is desirable.
Large plants prefer sandy or loamy soil, especially
limestone soil with irrigation about once a month, and some
shade.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">California Pincushion</span> (<i>Mammillaria tetrancistera</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>tetrancistera</i> in allusion to the four central spines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The California Pincushion grows from single stems a foot
high and two and one-half inches in diameter, or several in
a cluster. Sometimes the stems are branched and cylindrical
with a loose flabby texture. The root is narrow, conical,
and fleshy. The tubercles are usually less than a half-inch
long and loosely set in eight spiral rows. There are from
forty to sixty-five radial spines placed in two whorls, slender
and white with red-brown tips; also one to four central spines
which are strongly hooked, dark reddish brown or blackish.
The flowers are usually about two inches long and are
purplish. The sepals and petals are ciliate and covered with
many fine hairs.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This pincushion is not injured by temperatures fifteen or
twenty degrees below freezing and hence grows indoors or
out; it thrives in hot, sunny conservatories or greenhouses.
The plants grow easily from seed sown in sandy soil with
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
partial shade, the soil moist but not wet. Plants may be
transplanted at any season in sandy, stony, or gravelly soil,
and watered once in two or three weeks during dry spells.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Black Spined Pincushion Cactus</span> (<i>Mammillaria Milleri</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for Dr. Gerrett S. Miller, Jr., who first collected it near Phoenix, Arizona)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Black Spined Pincushion, another of the <i>Mammillaria</i>
genus of Cactace&aelig;, grows from single stems or several stems
in clumps which are sometimes branched, and from two to
nine inches high, two to three inches in diameter. The
stems are globose or cylindrical with the tubercles crowded
close together on their lower parts. These tubercles are
about one-third of an inch long, and are arranged symmetrically
in eleven to fourteen rows. There are from seventeen
to twenty radially placed spines, widely spreading and about
a half-inch long, with a white body and reddish brown tips;
also one to three central spines with upturned hooks, brownish
red appearing black at a distance. The flowers are
purple fading out to a pink, and bell-shaped. This handsome
desert species strongly resembles the beautiful Sunset Cactus,
but has much stouter and darker central spines.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This plant should be treated similarly to the Sunset Cactus.
Young plants grow readily from seed in moist sandy or loamy
soil in pots or flats in part shade. Older plants may be transplanted
at almost any season in rocky or gravelly soils and
watered once or twice a month during dry seasons. They
are not injured by temperatures twenty or twenty-five degrees
below freezing, but with greater cold than this must be protected
or grown in warm sunny conservatories.</p>

<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER IV
<br />THE PARADE OF THE DESERT FLOWERS</h2>
<p>The lover of plants and flowers which thrive on the desert
wastes has often but little conception of the mystic beauty
which lingers there, wrapped up in the delicate waxlike coverings
of these wondrous blossoms. Exotic and strikingly
beautiful, some of them are. It would seem that Nature, the
Great Gardener, has caused the mountains to grow their
huge trees bedecked in evergreen, snow-crowned and haloed
in gorgeous golden sunsets with tints of spectral beauty; the
humid plains to grow their grasses, somber and uninviting,
the providers of mankind, and their trees, low and squatty,
with shade for the tired herd and the dusty traveler, and
also their velvet grassy slopes lovely to look upon.</p>
<p>But what of the desert! Well, we do not intend to paint
you a picture of desolation, where no living thing can grow.
Out of the d&eacute;bris of worlds in the making, so to speak, there
was left the great Amphitheater of the Sun where the scorching
rays beat down. In this hot caldron of alkali and sand
and rock Nature went to work, and soon there appeared tiny
spiny shoots, leafy but devoid of color. All were hungry
and thirsty, and soon rain came, and then the transformation!
Water appeared under the surface, and slowly rose saturating
the tiny roots. The hot winds of the day turned to cooling
zephyrs of the night which gently kissed each plant and
flower until the coming of the sun. With each kiss of the
dew-laden night air came the delicate perfume and the wonderful
color scheme which make all the cacti so attractive to
the eye and so stirring to the senses. From crannies and
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
nooks, crevices and rock-cracks, along the foothills and on
the slopes, began to appear the haciendas of the flowers; in
time they thrived and multiplied. To-day on the great deserts
of the Southwest along the Arizona-California line and
eastward, there are vast stretches of cacti of every weave and
pattern imaginable, as symmetrical in design as though each
were first wrought on the Infinite Draughting Board and then
carefully and wisely planted by the Great Gardener to live
forever.</p>
<p>Our third trek starts from one of the beautiful California
or Arizona sites that dot the Colorado River bounding these
two states, leading into the gullies, draws, or ca&ntilde;ons that are
so numerous there, in search of a peculiar and striking growth
commonly known as the Hedgehog Cactus. Since the species
are very thorny, the comparison to the little animal so
full of bristles is an apt one. The scientific name, <i>Echinocereus</i>,
taken from the Latin <i>echinus</i>, hedgehog, and <i>cereus</i>,
torch, or the Hedgehog-Torch.</p>
<h3>GROWTH AND HABITATS</h3>
<p>The Hedgehog cacti are of the easiest culture in out-of-door
gardens, blossoming and fruiting profusely, but in
greenhouse cultivation they rarely flower; they thrive in any
ordinary clay loam with some gravel or coarse sand and with
good drainage, and the desert species will even tolerate some
alkali. The fruit looks like a mass of enormous bright red
strawberries, and when cooled in the refrigerator, sliced and
served with cream and sugar is delicious, and sought after
as a great delicacy by the Indians and Mexicans. This
marked resemblance has earned for <i>Echinocereus</i> Cacti the
common name, also, of &ldquo;Strawberry Cactus.&rdquo; When the
berries ripen, their spine clusters fall away or may be removed
with the least effort. The writers have tasted this
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
delicious fruit served cold and also as a sauce and made into
jam.</p>
<p>Strawberry Cacti are among the most popular plants for
southwestern cactus gardens and rock gardens because of
their fine showy flowers, and their profuse blooming and
fruiting. A single plant in the University of Arizona Cactus
Garden during the present year had fifty full-blown flowers
at one time and continued in blossom for fully two weeks.
In culture the plants may be watered regularly once a month
in the absence of rain during the growing season; they require
little other care. They may be transplanted at any season
provided the roots are not seriously injured, and when transplanted
early in spring they blossom during that same season.
Like other desert cacti, the Hedgehog or Strawberry
Cactus grows best in sunny locations. The plants grow with
single stems or in clumps, and from three inches to a foot
and a half tall; others are solitary, and some in large flat
masses or hemispherical mounds. The flowers are crimson
and scarlet and pink and deep purple, and grow in heavy
masses; some are funnel-shaped and bell-shaped.</p>
<p>As we start on our journey early in May, we travel down
a long, broad, well paved highway, straight toward the rising
sun. It is still quite cool, but the day will be blazing-hot before
long. In the distance a blue haze hovers over Superstition
Range for whose almost roadless ca&ntilde;ons and draws we
are bound. As we proceed along the highway, the cacti get
thicker and thicker, and as far as the eye can see are many
kinds of Cholla, Pincushion, and Barrel cacti. Here and
there is a stranger to us. We are at last in a veritable museum
of desert cacti and their flowers. It might be called
the &ldquo;Parade of the Cactus Flowers,&rdquo; for they are all around
and about us. We are hunting for the little Hedgehog, and
indeed we find him in plenty. There are about sixty different
varieties of this particular group of the Cactus Family&mdash;all
very beautiful and interesting, and some of them hide away
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
so carefully and select such forbidden haunts that it takes a
long time to find them.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">California Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus mojavensis</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern California, Southern Utah, Southern Nevada, and Northwestern Arizona</i></p>
<p>The California Hedgehog Cactus, or the Mojave Hedgehog,
we espy first, and how could one miss seeing the scarlet
bloom suffused with nopal red of this strange and beautiful
Strawberry Cactus? The flaming blossoms, two or three
inches long and an inch or so across, with short broad thick
petals, borne singly though many grow on a single stem, remain
open for several days at a time, and cause the California
Hedgehog to become one of the most brilliant of the Strawberry
group. The massive mounds of white-spined stems,
two to six or seven inches long, often several hundred in a
clump, covered with flashes of crimson flowers form a
bright-colored zone which in full blossom is a splendid sight,
and at a distance suggests a fire burning, with nothing to
burn and sans smoke. This species is called the Desert-Afire,
or Burning Cactus, or the Mojave Hedgehog as it was discovered
on the Mojave Desert, and the name <i>Echinocereus</i> or
Torch Cactus was first given to it. A close cousin is the
Crimson Flowered Hedgehog Cactus of northern Arizona
and New Mexico and Utah.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Golden Spined Strawberry Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus chrysocentrus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern California, Western Arizona, and Northern Mexico</i></p>
<p>Here in Southern California thrives the Golden Spined
Albino, a foot or so in height; the two-inch stems are furrowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
with a dozen or so ridges, on the sides of which appear
interlocking scallops, of a yellow or medium deep greenish
cast. It has golden or light yellow spines like the pale yellow
or cream-colored hair of the albino, hence the common
name is quite apropos. It is to the circle of eight to thirteen
radial spines with their lovely golden hue that the specific
title <i>chrysocentrus</i> refers. The Golden Spined Strawberry
Cactus with its pink and lavender-pink flowers is a rare and
beautiful sight on the desert here before us, set in the dull
tan or brown background of sand and rocks, and with
scarcely a green leaf or other color now in sight. The inch-long
fruit is densely spiny, covered with long, slender golden
thorns, edible and sweet; it ripens in August, a month or so
later than the fruit of the <i>Echinocereus Engelmannii</i>, its
nearest relative.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Indian Strawberry Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Engelmannii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Western Arizona, Northern Mexico, Southern Utah, Southern Nevada, and Southern California</i></p>
<p>Here is the <i>Echinocereus Engelmannii</i>, or Engelmann&rsquo;s
Hedgehog Cactus. This fine Strawberry Cactus may be
found clinging to the foothills and low mountains in arid,
sandy or gravelly desert land, growing in clumps of a few
to twenty or more stems, six inches to a foot or more high
and two or three inches through, rather cylindrical. This
fine species is very appropriately named in honor of Dr.
George Engelmann of St. Louis, one of the greatest authorities
on cacti. Deep purple-pink flowers appear in early
spring, seeming at times to be clustered because of the masses
of brilliantly tinged blossoms three to four inches long;
though in reality they grow singly on the stems, and bloom
for several days, opening in the forenoon and closing toward
evening. The thirteen to seventeen stiff awl-shaped radial
spines, one-fourth inch to one inch long, and the three or four
stout firm central thorns remind one of stiff tousled medium
brown hair partly turned gray, the colors being grayish, tan,
and brownish, all mixed together. The fruit, enormous
&ldquo;strawberries,&rdquo; is covered by many spine clusters which at
maturity are easily rubbed off, leaving it quite smooth, of a
deep purple-red, with many small black seeds set in a pinkish
mass of sweet tender pulp. The Pima and Papago Indians
are very fond of this luscious cactus strawberry when
fully ripe and served with cream and sugar or cooked into
the most delicious conserves and jam; they gather it in considerable
quantities and occasionally one can buy the fruit
or preserves in their markets, in Arizona, Southern California
or old Mexico. And so Dr. Engelmann&rsquo;s Strawberry
Cactus has earned the name, also, of the Indian Strawberry
Cactus, or &ldquo;Desert Strawberry.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Spiny Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus polyacanthus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Mexico, Southern Arizona, and Texas</i></p>
<p>It is in Northern Mexico that we glimpse the Spiny Hedgehog
Cactus, or, as the scientist names him for his many
spines, <i>Echinocereus polyacanthus</i>, a fierce thorny little fellow.
He has fifteen sharp stout spines, somewhat flask-shaped
at the bases, and spreading, at first pale yellow, then
becoming pinkish gray or grayish purple with the tips mostly
darker, deep yellow to blackish shades. His flame-red blossoms,
sometimes tinged with orange, are called single though
they seem to be clustered when abundant&mdash;large striking
flowers, several blooming at one time in early and late spring,
and remaining open for days, not closing up at night.
Though not specially abundant, <i>polyacanthus</i> is one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
commoner varieties of the low mountains and foothills on
the desert.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Salmon Flowered Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Leeanus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Mexico</i></p>
<p>A lustrous mass of flame-colored blossoms attracts our
attention next, as we speed along the highway intent on
making camp for the night across the United States line
from Mexico. It is the Salmon Flowered Hedgehog Cactus,
whose large, wide-spreading petals (two or three inches
across the flower), are of a brilliant salmon hue, showy and
attractive, and remain open for several days at a time in
the spring, not even closing at night. The blossoms are
borne near the tips of the stems, and as many as ten or twelve
are in bloom at a time. Though not native to the United
States, the Salmon Flowered Hedgehog is occasionally found
in cactus gardens in Arizona and California, and is well
known to cactus connoisseurs and gardens in Europe. The
species was named <i>Leeanus</i> in honor of James Lee of England,
who presented the type specimen to the Royal Botanic
Gardens at Kew about 1842.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Rose&rsquo;s Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Rosei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, and Northern Mexico</i></p>
<p>We have crossed the boundary line into the United States
at Nogales, Arizona, and now in the early morning sunlight
are approaching the low Gila Range in southeastern Arizona.
We have come to study a cactus which closely resembles that
fierce little fellow, the Spiny Hedgehog Cactus, from which
it differs in having very short and sparse hairs on the fruit and
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
calyx tube. It has been described only recently, and thrives
in western Texas, southern New Mexico, old Mexico, and
southern Arizona, along the <i>bajadas</i> in rocky or gravelly
soil, sometimes in sandy soil on the dry mesas and low mountain
sides. Growing in clumps of fifteen to forty stems,
four to ten inches tall, pale green or blue-green, it has fourteen
or more firm needlelike radial and central spines, pinkish
and brownish gray, and bright scarlet flowers bearing six
hundred or more stamens, purple anthers, and dull scarlet
filaments. Unlike most cactus flowers these blossoms remain
open for several days and nights in succession, in April,
occasionally blooming into May. The berries ripen in June,
dropping their spine clusters then. The fruit of Rose&rsquo;s
Hedgehog Cactus is about an inch long, greenish purple when
ripe, edible, with a pleasant, tart, gooseberrylike taste.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Fendler&rsquo;s Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Fendleri</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern Arizona, Mexico, Western Texas, Utah, and New Mexico</i></p>
<p>Like many of his kind Fendler&rsquo;s Hedgehog Cactus blooms
during the day and folds up his petals at night. There are
eight to thirteen stout radial spines, spreading and occasionally
appearing comb-like in arrangement, white fading to
gray, and usually tipped with brown; also a very stout central
thorn or two, sometimes an inch and a half long, dark-colored
and curving upward. He has deep pink, rose and
rose-purple bloom nearly four inches long and about as wide,
appearing in April and May. This is one of the finest and
most abundant of our Strawberry or Hedgehog Cacti; occasionally
plants will have as many as fifty blossoms open at
a time. Amidst desert surroundings with the gray or brown
of the great arid spaces for a background they make a
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
glorious sight, and one wonders how it is possible for so
fine a flower to grow on the sandy gravelly foothills without
any attention or care from the hand of man. Here again
it is Nature, the Great Gardener, with her marvelous science
and daring ingenuity, who enables her plants to receive life
and sustenance through the miraculous reservoirs of root
and stem, even amid the burning sun and drying winds of the
great desert of the Southwest.</p>
<p>The fruit, about an inch and a half long, is armed with numerous
clusters of short brown-tipped spines. When ripe
it is light yellow, pink, or purple-red, and the thorns, then,
are easily rubbed off leaving the surface entirely smooth.
The mature fruit served with cream and sugar is delicious
and suggests strawberries; it is used as an article of food
and for barter among the Indians and Mexicans. A large
plant bears one or two quarts of the luscious fruit, in late
May or early June. Hence this cactus, too, is called the Indian
or Desert Strawberry Cactus. The species is named
in honor of August Fendler, who collected extensively in
New Mexico and Arizona in the early days.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Rainbow Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus rigidissimus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern Arizona and Sonora</i></p>
<p>Here is a real beauty, <i>Echinocereus rigidissimus</i>, the lovely
Rainbow Cactus, so called from the many colors of her
spines arranged in bands a half-inch to an inch wide, one
following another in quick succession extending around the
plant. This beautiful desert growth is a great favorite in
cactus collections, but unfortunately, when removed from her
natural habitat, she pines away and is short-lived. The
scientific name <i>rigidissimus</i> refers to her spines, which are
noticeably stiff.</p>
<p>Among rocks and stones on hillsides in exposed and sunny
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
locations, we find the beauteous Rainbow, her bright rose-purple
flowers with their yellowish eyes, large and showy
and funnel-shaped. Solitary they are, and grow only a few
on a plant; and the rose-pink and purple petals and stamens,
with their orange-red anthers forming a circle about the
rose-purple style and olive-green stigmas, are a sight truly
admired by every one fortunate enough to see it in full
bloom. The Mexicans have nicknamed her <i>Cabecita del
Viejo</i> because she clings to the foothills and rocky mountain
slopes. Four to fifteen inches tall, at a little distance
she appears banded with white or cream-colored, yellow,
rose-purple, pink, or maroon-purple bands, while the two
dozen or so ridges appearing vertically around the stems
about a half-inch apart are green and yellow-green in hue.
The beautifully mottled thorns, a half-inch or so long, are
pressed closely against the plant, arranged mostly in two
comb-like groups and forming a continuous dense spiny layer
over the entire growth. The last spines of each season are
rose-purple or maroon, the earlier ones pink, yellowish, or
whitish; and thus are formed the zones of color extending
around the plant, the brighter or deeper hues of the spines
appearing during periods of slow growth, the yellow or
whitish coloring during the time of faster growth in the
spring. The inner part of the stems of <i>rigidissimus</i>, along
with the sweet and pulpy ripe fruit, is relished and eaten by
Indians and Mexicans, who consider it a rare delicacy.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Short Spined Strawberry Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Bonker&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern Arizona</i></p>
<p>We are nearing the beautiful Pinal Mountains in southeastern
Arizona, nearing also the end of our journey over
the broad expanse of the Arizona-California desert. After
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
all it is one desert; California, Arizona&mdash;what are mere
geographical lines or names in the desert land of plants and
flowers, in that vast natural amphitheater of the great
Southwest? Here in the long low rays of the afternoon sun
we see at a distance the purple haze gathering over the
mountain peaks, and we know that our day&rsquo;s work is nearing
completion with the coming of the beautiful sunset hour.
And here it is, four thousand feet up in the rocky foothills,
that we espy the rare little beauty <i>Echinocereus Bonker&aelig;</i>,
named for Frances Bonker, one of the authors of this book.
It is a new Strawberry Cactus, growing in the foothills and
low mountain ranges of southeastern Arizona, and was discovered
only last year in the Pinal Mountains and also near
Oracle, Arizona. It differs from all other species of its
kind in that all the spines are very short, and its fruit is
sweet and more nearly the size of a strawberry than any
of the others; also the spines do not suggest the Hedgehog
Cactus, so that the common name of Short Spined Strawberry
Cactus is given to <i>Bonker&aelig;</i>, as more nearly resembling
a strawberry in its fruit than any other of the Strawberry
Cactus clan. The juicy, luscious berries, less than an
inch long, are delicious as jam or served cold with cream;
they are always the first to appear in the spring.</p>
<p>Often but two inches tall, sometimes reaching six or eight
inches, this little Strawberry Cactus grows in clumps of two
or three to ten stems which are densely ridged and tubercled.
The flowers, nearly three inches long and about the same in
width, are a deep rose-purple, and appear in April, the first
of the purple-flowered species to bloom. It is easily recognized
by its many ridges and very short spines, all less than
a half-inch long, which are whitish or yellowish when young
and reddish brown when mature, and by its bright purple
blossoms, borne well up on the stems, which open in the
forenoon and close in late afternoon, lasting for several days.
Under cultivation the larger plants grow as much as three
inches in a season.</p>

<p>Our journey is almost ended, and our notebooks are filled
with much interesting matter about cacti heretofore unknown;
we have found and studied many interesting specimens
of the cactus family perhaps never before seen by the
majority of travelers. We know now that it is necessary
to see them from both far and near to appreciate the loveliness
of these weird desert growths; and it seems very
strange to us that so much glorious color and beauty has to
be hidden away out here underneath the midnight blue of
the sky, for only a privileged few to enjoy.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Crimson Flowered Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus coccineus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado</i></p>
<p>Yet one more of the lovely Strawberry group must be added
to our list, growing far up in the towering mountains of
northern Arizona and hence not included in this present trek.
The Crimson Flowered Hedgehog Cactus is this flaming
cactus flower, which grows generally at altitudes of five to
seven thousand feet, its scarlet blossoms flashing here and
there over the mountain slopes, or dotting the oak, juniper,
and pine formations in dense masses of brilliant hue, compact
clumps one to six feet across of twenty to three hundred
stems all closely set together; usually growing in rounded
mounds which exclude all other growth, and sometimes comprising
an important part of the pine and juniper plant coverings.
The stems are five to seven inches high, green and
yellow-green, forming a pleasing contrast to the crimson
blossoms. The translucent whitish spines, about a dozen
in number, are flask-shaped at their bases and spreading,
while the flowers are slightly fragrant, a rare characteristic
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
among the <i>Echinocereus</i> group. The fruit is spiny, and grows
from densely felted masses which remain as scars on the
stems for years. This Hedgehog Cactus may be easily distinguished
from <i>Echinocereus Rosei</i> by its white or yellowish
white spines.</p>
<p class="tb">And now the desert flower parade of color and beauty
has passed in review. One is not sorry to have come, for
even when the days are hot and dusty, the cooling desert
winds appear with the approach of night. We recall having
read a great deal about the magic and lure of the desert
and its wondrous plants and flowers, and we realize now
that one must come and <i>see</i> them to appreciate the beauty
that lives and thrives away out there underneath the stars,
forever guarded by that All-seeing Providence which placed
them there so carefully and wisely that they might tell us
something of His Plan of things entire, wherein the smallest
blade of grass receives from Nature as does the wisest seer;
for the Infinite Mind of Nature is no respecter of persons or
things, and treats plants and animals and humans without
favor or prejudice, portraying therein God&rsquo;s eternal care
and watchfulness over all.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Hedgehog or Strawberry Cactus Group</span> (<i>Echinocereus</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how they grow</h4>
<p>Plants grow with single stems or more often in clumps
from three inches to a foot and a half or so tall, sometimes
in large flat masses or in hemispherical mounds. The stems
are simple, rarely branched, tubercled, and covered with a
series of ridges running lengthwise from top to bottom;
these ridges are almost hidden by a dense network of spines
spreading out over the entire plant, and causing such a
marked resemblance to the hedgehog that the group is
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
named the &ldquo;Hedgehog Cacti.&rdquo; The Hedgehog Cacti can
be distinguished from young Sahuaro by the fact that the
thorns of <i>Echinocerei</i> form a lacework extending across
the ridges, almost hiding them, while in the Sahuaro the
network of spines is along the tops of the ridges and does
not extend across them. The thorns are mostly of two
kinds, centrals and radials, growing from less than half an
inch to three inches long. There are no spicules. The flowers
are funnel-shaped and bell-shaped, crimson and scarlet,
also occurring in pink and deep purples, large and showy, and
growing in heavy masses. They open in the forenoon and
close in the afternoon, lasting several days, or remain open
for three or four days or longer without closing. The fruit
looks like a mass of enormous bright red strawberries and
is delicious served with cream and sugar; hence the name
&ldquo;Strawberry Cacti.&rdquo; The unripe fruit is exceedingly spiny,
the thorns generally falling off at maturity or easily dislodged.
It has small tubercles which bear the spine clusters
and bracts.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>The Hedgehog Cacti are of the easiest culture in out-of-door
gardens, blossoming and fruiting profusely; in greenhouse
cultivation they rarely flower. They thrive in any
ordinary clay loam with some gravel or coarse sand (even
tolerating a little alkali), and with good drainage. The
plants may be watered regularly once a month in the absence
of rain during the growing season; they require little other
care. They may be transplanted at any season provided the
roots are not seriously injured; when transplanted early in
spring, they blossom during the same season. Sometimes
Hedgehog Cacti can be grown from cuttings made from the
stems; the cut surface should be allowed to dry and the cutting
set about two inches deep in moist sandy soil. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
usual method is to grow these plants from seeds sown in
sandy soil mixed with a small amount of powdered charcoal
and leaf mold, a quarter-inch deep in flats or pots set in part
shade and with enough water to keep the soil moist. When
a half-inch high, the seedlings are transplanted to small pots,
and later from there to the garden. A southern exposure is
very desirable.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">California or Mojave Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus mojavensis</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for the Mojave Desert where it was discovered)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The stems of the Mojave Hedgehog Cactus are as long
as seven inches and of a pale green. The structure of the
stems furnishes a dozen or so ribs, and this arrangement
provides the necessary strength for support. The plant is
covered with a whitish system of spines, slender and bent
and in age becoming gray. The spines are radial; they are
not long but are dangerous to touch. The flowers of this
little plant are scarlet and remain open for several days; they
are rather small, not more than an inch and a half across.
The petals are mostly thick and broad and have obtuse tips
that are sometimes notched, while the ovary has white felted
areolas covered with short needlelike spines for protection.
The fruit is elliptical, about the size of an English walnut,
and ripens in May and June. We have found that the plants
grow in loose clumps, forming into mounds among the shifting
sands, a conspicuous feature on the desert and foothills
with their flaming bloom, hence called also the Desert-Afire.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>These plants will grow outdoors where temperatures descend
to twenty or twenty-five degrees below freezing; in
colder climates they may be grown in hot, dry conservatories
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
or rock gardens. Like others of this group the plants may
be transplanted at almost any season, and if planted in early
spring they blossom the same year. They grow in sandy
or loamy soil with enough water to keep the soil moist during
the growing season; they endure prolonged drought in their
native habitats and hence should not be watered excessively
in cultivation.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Golden Spined Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus chrysocentrus</i>&mdash;<i>Echinocereus Engelmannii</i>, variety <i>chrysocentrus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named &ldquo;chrysocentrus&rdquo; from its beautiful golden or light yellow translucent spines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The physical structure of the Golden Spined Hedgehog
Cactus consists of cylindrical stems to fifteen inches in height,
tapering off towards the ends or tops and covered with many
scalloped ridges on which the radial spines are placed&mdash;which,
by the way, as usual in all cactus plants, are dangerous
because they are so sharp and so thickly intertwined. The
scallops of adjacent ridges are interlocking, and light green
or yellow. It is here that the areolas, or centers of growth,
appear, densely covered with tiny hairs. The spine system
is grouped and spreading, with four to seven central spines
sometimes three inches in length, often crooked or twisted,
and surrounded by smaller radials scattered along the stem
ridges, not more than a fourth-inch to an inch long, all thorns
of a beautiful golden or light translucent yellow. The
spines often vary in their general characteristics, long and
short, twisted and bulbous, straight and bent and twisted,
flat and grooved, tough and easily broken. The flowers
are about the length of a large duck egg, and consist of the
usual sepals and petals. The colorings vary from a light
pink toning into beautiful deeper lavender tints, then lavender
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
filaments and yellow anthers and stigma lobes of deep green,
presenting a very beautiful color combination. Golden
Spined Cacti grow well in clumps along the arid gravelly
slopes of the rocky foothills of southeastern California,
western Arizona, and Sonora.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants can be grown out of doors, and are not injured with
twenty degrees of frost. They grow readily from seed in
pots or flats in moist sandy soil, preferably with part shade
for the first few months, but with a dry atmosphere. Large
plants can be transplanted late in winter or early in spring
in gravelly or rocky soil with a sunny exposure, and watered
once or twice a month during the growing season to keep
the soil slightly moist.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Indian or Desert Strawberry; Engelmann&rsquo;s Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Engelmannii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. George Engelmann of St. Louis, one of the greatest authorities on cacti)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Indian or Desert Strawberry Cactus, like others of
the Hedgehog clan, has a system of cylindrical stems which
grow about fifteen inches tall, with a diameter of two to
three inches, and the usual ridges along which are placed
the many sharp spines. The stems are yellow or greenish
yellow and of course fade a little with age. Quite regularly
along the ridges there are radially placed spines an
inch long or less, and these make a formidable armor against
intrusion. The stout, firm, erect, or spreading central spines
are twice as long as the radials. All these thorns have
bulbous bases and most are grooved, curved, and twisted;
the colors are whitish to red-brown. The large flowers are
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
about the width of a teacup, the sepals and petals usually
bright pink with beautiful light purple tinting, while the filaments
are pale lavender and the anthers yellow&mdash;another
striking color scheme of Nature&rsquo;s combination. The fruit
is elliptical, of the size of a very small egg, and quite spiny.
This cactus grows well in groups of twenty or so on the
sandy gravelly mesas or along the rocky slopes, and is a
very characteristic species on the arid southwestern deserts.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>These plants grow outside without injury from twenty or
twenty-five degrees of frost; in colder climates they should
be protected out of doors or grown in a dry, hot, sunny glass
house. Large plants are transplanted easily in early spring,
with care not to injure the roots or stems; they thrive in
gravelly, stony soils with occasional watering to keep moisture
in the soil during the growing season. Young plants grow
easily from seed with the usual care, moist sandy soil, partial
shade, and a dry atmosphere.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Spiny Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus polyacanthus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>polyacanthus</i> from its many spines, though it is not as spiny as some other species)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Spiny Hedgehog Cactus consists of a cylindrical system
of stems growing to ten inches in height, about two
inches in diameter, with the usual system of ridges, nine to
eleven or so. It has the same spine clusters along these
ridges, radially arranged, and with the central spines the
longer, nearly two inches in length. In this case the spine
bases are flask-shaped and spreading. At first the colors are
pale yellow, later becoming grayish, pink-gray, or purple-gray
with darker tips. This change denotes the age of the plant.
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
The flowers appear near the tips of the stems and are about
three inches long, with eighteen petals that are thick and firm
and spatulate, colorings ranging from yellowish green bases
to flame or orange-red blades. There are six sepals of
orange-red. The ovary has yellow spines with dense tufts of
long cottony hairs in the areolas. The plants grow on foothills
and low mountains from western Texas to southeastern
Arizona in clumps of ten to twenty or more. They often
form in compact mounds, and they bloom during April
and May.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants are not injured by temperatures as low as zero, but
in lower temperatures they require protection. They may
be grown in cool, sunny greenhouses, but they blossom best
with outdoor planting. The plant may be set out at almost
any season&mdash;but early spring is best&mdash;in gravelly loam or
among rocks, with care not to injure the root or stem. The
seed grow readily in sandy loam in pots or flats, in diffused
sunlight, with just enough water to keep the soil moist. In
cactus gardens the plants should be given only enough water
to keep the soil moist during dry spells, and growth should
not be forced.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Salmon Flowered Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Leeanus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>Leeanus</i> in honor of James Lee of England, who presented the type specimen to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew about 1842)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The <i>Leeanus</i>, or Salmon Flowered Cactus, is identified by
the general characteristics of the entire Hedgehog Group.
It is cylindrical, with the stems tapered toward the tips,
about four inches through near the base, and with ten to
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
twelve rounded ridges with acute apexes. Along these
ridges the usual system of spines is placed, with the shorter
ones radially arranged and very sharp. These radial spines
are unequal in length and are spreading from their bases,
while the centrals are stouter, the lowest two inches or so
long, all thorns having bulbous bases and a tannish brown
color scheme, toning off to gray. The flowers are among the
largest of the salmon or scarlet forms&mdash;when opened, about
the length of a large egg&mdash;and have twenty-seven broad
thick petals, the tips well rounded; or the petals may be
notched or tipped with a short point. The general colorings
are from orange-red to a flaming salmon; hence the
common name. There are many stamens of about the same
length as the style and stigmas. The style branches are light
green and are incurved. The stems of this cactus grow
singly or in loose clusters, and thrive well in sandy or
gravelly loam.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Little is known about growing this species under cultivation;
it transplants readily at almost any season and thrives
in sandy or gravelly loam with occasional irrigation to keep
the soil moist during dry periods. It may be grown outside
in temperatures not below twenty or twenty-five degrees of
frost; in colder weather it should have protection. It grows
well in cool conservatories, but does not blossom freely there.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Rose&rsquo;s Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Rosei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for Dr. John Nelson Rose, Associate in Botany, United States National Museum, Washington, D. C.)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>Dr. Rose&rsquo;s Hedgehog Cactus is also of the cylindrical stem
variety, has nine to a dozen obtuse ribs in its structure, and
is pale green or bluish green. The usual ridges prevail and
are armored with clustering radial spines of unequal length,
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
very sharp and needlelike. Both radials and the longer
centrals are pinkish to brownish gray and have bulbous bases
which spread at the roots. In most of the other Hedgehog
species the colorings of the thorns vary somewhat. The
bright scarlet blossoms are about three inches long and remain
open for several days and nights. The petals are
broad and spatulate and a bit thick, not opening wide. The
filaments are dull scarlet, the anthers purple, and the stigma
lobes bright green. The scarlet hue in the color scheme
gives the plant a striking appearance on the desert, beautiful
to see. The fruit is elliptical and very spiny, a greenish
purple, and has a pleasant tart, gooseberrylike taste.
The stems grow in clumps of as many as forty, and range
from the low foothills and dry <i>bajadas</i> of southwestern
Texas to southern New Mexico and eastern Arizona.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>These plants grow well out of doors and are not injured
by zero temperatures. They will grow in cool, sunny greenhouses.
Transplant early in spring without injuring roots
or stems, in gravelly clay or rocky soils; give enough water
to keep the soil moist but not wet. Plants may be grown
from seed in the usual way, in pots or flats in sandy or loamy
soil in part shade, with enough water to keep the soil moist.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Desert or Indian Strawberry Cactus; Fendler&rsquo;s Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Fendleri</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of August Fendler, who collected extensively in New Mexico and Arizona in the early days)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Indian Strawberry Cactus, also, is built up of cylindrical
tapered stems, in groups of ten or twelve, of uneven
heights up to a foot, with a dozen or so wavy ribs and clustered
radially formed spines, a half-inch or so in length, wide-spreading
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and lying close to the stem. The stems are a
medium deep green. The radials are of a white cast toning
into brown at the tips, the stout centrals dark brown and
curving upwards. All the thorns have swollen bases and are
more or less variable in color. The flowers are of deep
purple and about three inches broad and long. There are
as many as twenty petals and fourteen sepals varying from
rose-pink to purple shades. The petals are spatulate and
somewhat broad, the margins finely toothed. The stamens
are rather short, and the anthers are yellow, while the filaments
are of a light pink, toning off to green. The flowers
open in the forenoon and close in the afternoon for several
days in succession. The fruit is not large, no larger than
a very small egg, and matures in May, when the colorings
range from pink to red or yellow. When fully ripe the little
spine clusters are easily rubbed off, so that it is not hard for
natives to handle the fruit.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Larger plants are not injured by zero temperatures; in
colder winter weather plants require some protection or may
be grown in cool, sunny glass houses. They may be transplanted
at any season in gravelly or loamy soil irrigated
enough to retain moisture during the growing season.
Young plants grow easily from seed sown in flats or pots in
sandy or loamy soil with some shade and with enough water
to keep the soil moist.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Rainbow Cactus; Cabecita del Viejo</span> (<i>Echinocereus rigidissimus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>rigidissimus</i> from the stiff spines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The <i>rigidissimus</i>, or Rainbow Cactus, another of the cylindrically
formed cacti, is easily identified by the noticeably stiff
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
spines, which are very numerous. The stems grow to about
fifteen inches tall, four inches or less in diameter with a
rounded-off top, singly, or branched above. The cylinder is
composed of about twenty-four ridges well covered with very
sharp radials, but with no central spines, a characteristic uncommon
in the Hedgehog group. There are great numbers
of radially placed spines, closely pressed to the sides of the
stem. They are arranged in two comb-like groups, one on
each side of the areolas, and interlock with thorns of adjacent
spine clusters. This makes a dense spine layer over the entire
surface of the plant. These spines are less than a half-inch
long, and have swollen bases. They form in many colored
zones, or whitish, yellow, rose-purple to maroon-purple bands
about the plant. The flowers are about three inches long and
as wide when full open, and have some forty petals and
thirty sepals. The petals have pointed tips and are bright
rose-purple with yellowish bases. The fruit is covered with
many spines, is about the size of a strawberry, fleshy and
sweet. The <i>rigidissimus</i> invariably grows along the rock
ridges and rocky foothill slopes at altitudes of thirty-five
hundred to fifty-five hundred feet, the roots growing among
the rocks. Its distinguishing characteristic is the many colored
bands of the spines around the plant, suggesting a
rainbow.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Rainbow Cacti are not injured in zero temperatures out
of doors, but with colder weather than this they require
some protection. They may be grown in cool, dry, sunny
conservatories. The Rainbow is one of the most difficult
of the cacti to grow under cultivation. Unless planted in
rocky soil, preferably early in spring, it will grow for only
a year or two. Young plants transplant more readily than
older ones, and neither the roots nor the stems should be injured
in digging. Give enough water to keep the soil moist
during the growing season. Plants may be grown from
seed in moist sandy soil in part shade or diffused sunlight.
When mature plants are used and transplanted in early
spring they blossom the same season.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Short Spined Strawberry Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus Bonker&aelig;</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for Frances Bonker, one of the authors of this book)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p><i>Bonker&aelig;</i>, or the Short Spined Strawberry Cactus, is oblong-cylindrical
with the tips somewhat depressed. It has
low obtuse ridges, fewer than twenty, of a light green.
These ridges are covered with a network of radial spines,
the younger ones whitish, fading to gray-white, yellow or
yellowish brown in age. The centrals are yellow-brown
changing to red-brown in older thorns. All the spines are
less than a half-inch long and vary in coloring, with brown
bulbous bases and translucent tips. This cactus is to be found
in clusters of from two to ten stems, and is very attractive with
its rose-purple to deep rose-purple flowers nearly three inches
long, and its many stamens, stigmas, and filaments in bright
and light green. The fourteen petals and nine sepals have
obtuse tips and short points; the styles are longer than the
stamens. Plants grow along the dry foothills and low mountains
in clumps of a foot or less across.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This species grows outdoors and is not injured by temperatures
twenty or twenty-five degrees below freezing; in
colder climates than this it must be given some protection
or grown in cool, dry, sunny greenhouses. Plants may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
grown at any season in gravelly or sandy clay soils with light
irrigation every two or three weeks to moisten the soil
during the growing season or in droughty periods. Or they
may be grown readily from seed sown in sandy loam in flats
or pots, with partial shade and with enough water to keep
the soil moist. The species is a handsome one for rock gardens,
as yet little known. Mature specimens transplanted
early in spring blossom the same season.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Crimson Flowered Hedgehog Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocereus coccineus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>coccineus</i> in allusion to the bright scarlet flowers)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p><i>Coccineus</i>, or the Crimson Flowered Hedgehog Cactus, is
built up of stems four to seven inches long and about two
inches in diameter. The tips of the stem are rounded and
covered with radial spines no more than three-quarters
of an inch long. It has three central spines which are
much stronger than the radials, all thorns erect and spreading.
They are flask-shaped at their bases and are white to
yellowish white. The flowers are a beautiful bright crimson,
about three inches long, and remain open for several
days before they close. The petals and sepals are thick and
firm, bright scarlet, and brownish or orange toward their
bases, while the tips of the petals are broadly rounded. The
fruit pods are very spiny. These plants grow in dense
clumps one to six feet across and two to three hundred stems
in a cluster, at altitudes of five to seven thousand feet in the
foothills and ca&ntilde;ons and along the lakes in northern Arizona,
New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, and in oak, juniper, and
pine formations of prairie lands. They prefer the gravelly
clay loam of the slopes in sunny exposures and are to be found
also among rocks on the high mesas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This species is not injured by temperatures twenty-five
degrees below zero, and hence may be grown out of doors
throughout the country generally. It furnishes very interesting
specimens for rock gardens. Plants grow readily
in gravelly loam or limestone soils and may be transplanted at
any season. They thrive even in the hot Southwest but
should be given partial shade there and moderate irrigation.
In these warmer climates they blossom as early as April
but rarely mature fruit. They grow easily from seed in
moist sandy soil or clay loam with part shade, and preferably
in cooler climates.</p>

<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER V
<br />THE PAINTED CANVAS OF THE DESERT</h2>
<p>There is nothing so beautiful as the dash of color painted
by that great artist, Nature, on the canvas of the desert in
the springtime and early summer. It is here that plant and
flower families vie with each other in their parade of color
and fashion. Likewise man, who is tired and hungry for
the great open spaces with his year&rsquo;s work behind him in the
spring, seeks the hidden byways trodden only by the few,
where he may tramp and meditate and commune with Nature.
He loves to hunt new places, to see new things, and then on
some winter&rsquo;s evening to lean back in his comfortable chair
and blow smoke rings around the places come back to him
again in fancy, where he found that odd piece of cactus lacework
and that patch-pattern of thorns and spikes and stems.
And he wonders, then, how such marvelous colorings could
be, and <i>why</i> they should be, away out in those forgotten places
far from the hoof-mark of a burro or the footprint of an
Indian or a daring tenderfoot.</p>
<p>The desert is not unlike some huge canvas stretched out
over vast distances of mesa and foothill, valley and mountain,
which takes on mysterious splashes of color during each
cycle of the spring, fading then in the heat of summer and
fall. Imagine if you can this tremendous stretch of the
desert-canvas tinted with all the minute tracings of the
aurora borealis. For to be sure the image of the great
painted canvas of the desert, if inverted and hung high in
the heavens so as to be seen in all its brilliance, might well
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
make a more splendid curtain than our own aurora borealis,
flashing intermittently across the northern skies in flaming
letters of crimson and gold.</p>
<p>It seems strange that some of the desert cacti select the
daytime, while others of the same family select the nighttime
to unfold their matchless bloom. It seems strange
that a plant with coarse colorless bark, gray and hoary as
with age, can have such delicate and splendid blossoms. It
seems strange that so brilliant a coloring can come from
such desolation as the desert seems to possess, where there is
little or no water and the days are hot and dry. It is
strange, indeed, but Nature works in mysterious and devious
ways her wonders to perform.</p>
<h3>GROWTH AND HABITAT</h3>
<p>This chapter treats of the <i>Opuntia</i> genus of Cactace&aelig;, the
well known group of Prickly Pears whose flower colorings
are remembered as being so exquisite and delicate, so vivid
and attractive both near and afar, the lovely tints and hues
so well graduated from the bases of the petals to their tips
and so symmetrical of distribution, that attention is at once
focused upon them. There are about two hundred sixty
species of the <i>Opuntia</i>, of which eighty-eight are in the
United States, eighty-seven in Mexico, and the remainder in
South America and the outlying islands. The genus <i>Opuntia</i>
includes not only the beautiful Prickly Pear but also the
familiar Cholla, that tall, stately, antlered plant of the desert
domain which frowns at you from along the highway as you
approach our no man&rsquo;s land from almost any direction.
Starting on a fourth trek into the habitats of cactus plants
early in May, we shall look for only the colorful Prickly
Pears, characterized by their large pear-shaped joints, the
&ldquo;flapjacks&rdquo; of the desert; characterized also by their large
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
flaming orange and yellow, or occasionally rich purple and
red blossoms, which open for only a short time during the
day and close when the shadows of the sun begin to bathe
the hills in orange and purples as the desert sunset approaches.
In a few cases they unfold for a short time the
following day, but most bloom for but the one period of five
to seven hours or so. Commonly the blossoms change from
yellow when they open to orange in the afternoon, and in
some species to red-orange. It is also noted that when the
flowers unfold for a second day, their bright colorings deepen
and darken in orange or red. We find that the clan of the
Prickly Pear nearly always have thorns different from those
of most other groups of Cactace&aelig; in that they are only of
one kind, though the sizes may vary. In the genus of
<i>Opuntia</i> there are no radial nor central spines; the thorns
are merely spines in the full sense of the word. We note
that the Prickly Pear is really a shrub with many stems
branching from the base, and that their pear-shaped joints
are in reality stems or branches and are not just leaves as
many suppose; the true leaves being very small and scalelike
and disappearing after a short time, withering away and
falling off. The species grow readily from these pearlike
joints, and this is a common method of propagating <i>Opuntia</i>.
They will also grow from seeds, but these develop very
slowly and require a long time in the ground before they
germinate.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Papago Fruit Cactus</span> (<i>Opuntia Blakeana</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>It is from Tucson, in the rocky foothills of southeastern
Arizona, that we start on our long trip across the state and
into old Mexico and California. The first of the lovely auroral
coloring to attract our notice is the low spreading Prickly
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Pear called <i>Opuntia Blakeana</i> in honor of Dr. William
Blake, who was formerly Geologist and Director of the
College of Mines and Engineering of the University of
Arizona. Forming in loosely
branched clumps on the desert,
eight feet or more across and only
a foot or so high, this growth is
most strikingly characterized by
its translucent brown fringe of
spicules along the margins of the
areolas and its needlelike purplish
brown thorns suffused with
gray toward the bases. The
brilliant orange-red and yellow
blossoms, nearly three inches
long and as broad, like most of
their sister species open and close
in the daytime, the sepals greenish
yellow toning off to an orange-red
base. Blooming time is in
April and May, the fruit comes
on in July; the latter when ripe
is used for food by the Pima and Papago Indians of Arizona,
and while they eat it both raw and cooked it is not utilized
as is that of some of the other and larger varieties.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Delicate Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia delicata</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>At altitudes of three to five thousand feet in the sandy
and clay loams across southern Arizona one may see a
prickly pear called <i>delicata</i> on account of its small size and
its slender joints and spines. This baby <i>Opuntia</i> was only
recently discovered and is considered a rare find, though
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
little is known about its distribution. The tiny plants are
sometimes but three inches high, growing to ten inches in
different specimens, with one or several stems, long needlelike
spines and large yellow flowers, as usual blooming in
the morning and closing up their petals in the afternoon.
New and interesting specimens of the cactus clan are discovered
now and then, and it gives the botanist and the layman
much pleasure to study and classify them, to look up their
haunts and habits and place them where they belong, so
that all may see and know them.</p>

<p>We are approaching the beautiful Santa Rita Mountains
not far from Tucson, Arizona, nearing also the end of our
long afternoon&rsquo;s work, for the blue and purple haze that
betokens the close of a hot desert day is gathering around
the distant peaks and the sun hangs low over the horizon,
seeming loath to bid farewell to mountain and desert ca&ntilde;ons
and to weary mortals here below. A symphony in purple and
yellow greets our tired eyes and brightens our jaded spirits
as we motor slowly along the highroad; and we stop to get
a closer view of this handsomest of all the brilliant <i>Opuntia</i>,
the Purple Prickly Pear. A dash of purple in the sepals
tones into golden yellow in petals and stamens of the large
beautiful blooms, three inches across when full open and
nearly four inches in length, the lemon and deep yellow flowers
in vivid contrast to the bright purple joints of <i>santa rita</i>
in the spring. Then in summer the densely glaucous gray-blue
joints form a striking color scheme together with the
bright purple fruit. Two to five feet tall, the plants branch
from a short thick trunk in numerous stemlike appendages
which look like so many &ldquo;flapjacks&rdquo; on the desert. They
prefer the gravelly or rocky soils at levels of three to five
thousand feet, and grow over drab <i>bajadas</i> and somber foothill
slopes near the high Santa Ritas, where they were discovered
by Dr. David Griffiths and named for this majestic
range which towers in sight of these brilliantly beautiful and
slender-spined pearlike cacti. These rare plants are finding
a place in many gardens throughout the Southwest, and
even abroad in England they may be grown satisfactorily in
indoor cactus gardens.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Smooth Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia laevis</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>The Smooth Prickly Pear is a dainty morsel, and how the
cattle like to espy it in the few open spaces where it ventures
to grow! For this cactus is nearly spineless and clings to
the inaccessible ca&ntilde;on slopes where stock cannot prey upon it.
In April and May it forms a striking picture on the desert
canvas, a great patch of large, showy, lemon-colored blossoms
peering forth from the jutting and protecting rocks on
all sides of the steep mountain cliffs here in southern Arizona;
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
in July it changes this brilliant coloring with almost
kaleidoscopic swiftness to purple and pink splashes of the
fine large fruit. Truly the
desert is aflame with glory
when the prickly pears come
forth in bloom! Is it the
soul of the Flower trying to
find expression in beauty
and fragrance, attuned to
the soul of the poet and the
lover of desert creation,
striving to grow in tune
with the Universe? Here
is a lesson, perchance, that
he who runs may read; for
those who can pierce the
vale of mysteries it is called
&ldquo;in tune with the Infinite.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Opuntia laevis</i> is three to
six feet tall with erect wide-spreading
branches ascending
from the base. A very
few needlelike spicules develop
along the stem,
crowned by the large striking
lemon-colored flowers
with orange-red centers,
nearly three inches long and as broad, opening in the
morning and folding up in late afternoon.</p>

satiny blooms shading
into red and orange

Texas in search of a peculiar Prickly Pear growing in the
vicinity of San Antonio, Texas; this <i>Opuntia</i> is widely cultivated
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
now in cactus gardens, and one should not miss it
even though it takes several hours to reach the destination.
A striking plant on account of its long lance-shaped joints,
Cow&rsquo;s Tongue grows three to five feet tall with a spread of
three to six feet, in spring covered with great satiny yellow
blossoms nearly four inches long, tinted in green and golden
shades, and forming in numerous patches, great splashes of
gold against the dull brown and grays of desert prairie lands
in southern Texas. The fruit is quite tasty (it is commercialized
by Mexicans), eaten raw and made into spicy
jam or syrup. We note the characteristic tongue-shaped
joints, a foot or two long, which give the plant its specific
name <i>linguiformis</i> (tongue-shaped), and also its common
name Cow&rsquo;s Tongue. The late afternoon shadows begin
to creep over the rolling prairies and the sun is sinking low
on the horizon in one last attempt to linger here awhile, ere
it sweeps our no man&rsquo;s land in a vast flood of glory and is no
more. Many tourists prefer to travel at this hour and while
the desert moon is shining, for the cool and alluring night
breezes render motoring delightful over the arid sands

to the large circular and disklike joints of the stems, nearly
a foot in diameter and about half an inch thick, which form
the many ascending and spreading branches of this shrub;
and it seems to us we could almost use them in throwing the
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
discus in the marvelous Olympiad Games to be held this
summer, here in the giant amphitheater of the sun. The
beautiful plants grow in large clumps about five feet high
and five to ten feet across, standing forth as most striking
figures on the desert canvas with their erect spreading pear-like
arms and the vivid harmony of color in their large and
brilliant blooms; glossy lemon-yellow shading into deep
orange, then the yellow-green tints of the sepals and the
cream-white suffused with a delicate pinkish cast of the club-like styles.
There is a little animal living on the desert known as the trade rat or pack
rat which invariably seeks the <i>Opuntia discata</i> for building his home;
if the habitat of this little rat is investigated about five bushels
of d&eacute;bris will be found including cactus joints, stems, sticks, and
even stones, all carefully piled away in and under these plants.
This is a sure sign of the pack rat&rsquo;s nest, for in such a home
his needs are all taken care of; the <i>discata</i> gives him protection
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
from wandering coyotes and dogs, water and food in its succulent stems, and
still more food in the ripe sweet fruit. The latter is covered
with many fine spicules and the Indians skillfully remove these by rubbing, so
as not to get the prickers into the fingers; for they are
very annoying and irritating if they find their way into the
flesh. The ripe fruit is gathered for food by Mexicans and Indians, who make
from it a fine syrup, delicious preserves and other delicacies.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Northern Mexico, Arizona, and Texas</i></p>
<p>Next in our journey across the land of the burning sun we
find Engelmann&rsquo;s Prickly Pear here in Northern Mexico&mdash;a
very fine, large Opuntia which grows also in Texas and
Arizona. This cactus like several others has been named in
honor of Dr. George Engelmann, an early outstanding student
of cacti. The plant is a rather large shrub six to
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
twelve feet across and three to five feet tall, with many
divergent and ascending branches from the base, these often
rooting and forming an impenetrable growth. Its large
bluish green joints contrast vividly in the spring with the
huge golden or lemon-yellow flowers which appear in great
numbers in April and May; while again in July there is another
marked contrast to the deep purple or maroon-purple
fruit, which is pear-shaped and often three inches long.
As many as sixteen fruit are borne on a single joint or pad
of the Prickly Pear. These the Mexicans and Indians eat
when ripe, and the natives make a most palatable syrup
from the jams or conserves.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Long Spined Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia macrocentra</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Mexico, Central Arizona, and Western Texas</i></p>
<p>The <i>Opuntia macrocentra</i> grows in sandy soil or clay
loam at levels of three to five thousand feet. The plants
are no more than three feet tall and are called <i>macrocentra</i>
in allusion to the long spines, over three inches in length.
The large showy blossoms are about three inches long with
light yellow petals and bright red or orange-red centers.
This flower also opens and closes in the daytime and lasts for
one day only. The olive-green joints of the plants, which are
suffused with purple or sometimes purple throughout,
the dark purple-brown spines, and the yellow bloom create
an uncommon sight here on the open desert out over the
mesas and <i>bajadas</i> in Northern Mexico.</p>

<p>In southeastern California we run across that odd and
interesting little Prickly Pear with its many spicules appearing
like a small fuzzy tail, and hence called by the natives
Beaver Tail. Because of its habit of growth and its spineless
joints of light blue or blue-gray and bright rose-colored
flowers, the <i>basilaris</i> is different from all other Prickly Pear
cacti. Beaver Tail blooms profusely, and when in blossom
the clumps of plants on the mesas are bright rose and purple,
the flowers almost completely hiding the shrubs and forming
a brilliant splash of hue and tint, a solid, unbroken patch
of color on the gray or brown stretches of mesa and foothill.</p>
<p><i>Basilaris</i> prefers the most arid and sterile sandy or gravelly
soil at altitudes of a thousand feet and less, on the
<i>bajadas</i> of Nevada, Utah, western Arizona, and here in
Southern California. This cactus does not grow very tall,
seldom more than a foot, and the spread of the rosettelike
growth is about three feet across. The large beautiful
blooms, three inches long and nearly as broad, appear in
clusters on the margin of a joint, opening in the forenoon
and closing as the sunlight fades. There are no spines, and
the closely set areolas, crowded with spicules which are easily
dislodged, form the chief protection of the shrub; spicules are
very small and light and when dried fall off, and carried by
the wind are easily caught in one&rsquo;s clothing or body; they
are effective protectors and neither rodents nor grazing
animals eat plants where they appear and even man fears
them more than cactus thorns because of the difficulty of extracting
them and on account of the pain and sores which
they cause.</p>

<p>We are approaching the lovely Santa Monica range in
Southern California. Mt. San Bernardino with his crown
of snow towers in the distance; Mt. Baldy with his white
head bald almost the entire year round, we perceive even
farther west; and magnificent old San Gorgonio rears his
stately crest far above
all the surrounding
peaks. This is one
of the most beauteous
spots in Southern California.
The vast
depths of that great
natural amphitheater
near Redlands and Riverside
as viewed from
Smiley Heights form
a panorama gorgeous
beyond description,
with every color of
the rainbow brilliantly
present, a marvelous
thrilling picture
painted against the
landscape far and
near: marvelous in its
splashes of purples and
greens and pinks and
orange-reds against
the somber background
of the grand old mountains;
thrilling in the vastness of the limitless panorama
spread out before us on all sides, as we stand here on Smiley
Heights gazing into the great ca&ntilde;ons below, which seem to
magnetize us against our will and to draw us down into their
depths by the sheer force of distance immeasurable. Truly
a fit setting for our little <i>Opuntia Covillei</i>, playing his
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
humble part in all this gorgeous portraiture of plant and
flower, mountain and valley and rocky cliff; and with the
touch of the Master Artist he takes his modest place in the
great aurora borealis of the desert. Bright yellow and
nearly four inches long are his large beautiful blooms, toning
into the green of the stigma lobes in a happy combination of
Nature&rsquo;s making, and forming, over the two- or three-foot
stems with their pale blue-green joints or dull green pearlike
appendages, a becoming aureole of gold, quite dazzling in the
brilliant sunlight. Sometimes he grows in dense thickets
several yards across and fringed with thick clusters of inch-long
brown and yellowish white spines and spicules, sharp
and needlelike, harshly repulsing the daring tourist who presumes
to pluck his beautiful blossoms too rashly.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Flapjack Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia chlorotica</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California, Arizona, Lower California, Northern Mexico, New Mexico, and Nevada</i></p>
<p>We are nearing the end of our long quest for the brilliant
Prickly Pears, having crossed the Arizona and California
deserts on our way, dipped down into southern Texas and
Northern Mexico, and now are intent on finding a distinctive
growth here in southwestern California called <i>Opuntia
chlorotica</i>. Light purple is the fruit of this typical cactus,
the stems yellow or light green; straw-colored and brownish
are the slender bristlelike spines, translucent yellow the spicules.
Almost a gay rainbow of itself, <i>chlorotica</i> graces the
mountain ca&ntilde;ons and foothills of six great sections of the vast
southwestern desert. A short trunk, half a foot or a foot
tall, branches into many jointed &ldquo;flapjacks&rdquo; six to ten inches
long and about as wide, which combine to form a compact
rounded head three to six feet high. The scaly fissured faces
of the pearlike basal joints so typical of the prickly pear are
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
light brown and purplish, the others pale green and bluish
green; the slender yellowish spicules are not quite half an
inch long, the bristling spines a trifle longer. The bloom,
as of so many of the prickly pear species, is of a light lemon-yellow
with a brilliant orange-red center, about two and one-half
inches long and across; like others of this clan it opens
early in the morning, closing when the late afternoon shadows
begin to spell the end of the hot desert day. Seldom appearing
in clumps, generally growing alone, <i>chlorotica</i> delights to
cover the foothills and low mountain ca&ntilde;ons with her pretty
lemon blossoms, her short stout trunks, and their numerous
flat pearlike joints.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Porcupine Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia hystricina</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada</i></p>
<p>As we approach Los Angeles, California, we recall a peculiar
little growth in northern Arizona, Nevada, and New
Mexico called <i>Opuntia hystricina</i>; also the Porcupine Prickly
Pear, its long slender needlelike spines, reddish or red-brown,
giving the plant a shaggy appearance strongly resembling
that bristling little animal. In fact the name of the
species <i>hystricina</i> comes from the Greek word for &ldquo;porcupine.&rdquo;
Only a foot or so tall, its thorny stems spread out
into loose clumps, the flat hairy joints, five or six inches long,
looking just like so many bristling young porcupines; then
with a crescent mass of light yellowish spicules an eighth-inch
long or less, and six to ten finely grooved white and brownish
spines, encircled sometimes with white and brown bands.
In lovely contrast appear the beautiful large purple blossoms,
three inches long and with as great a spread when fully expanded
in April or May, opening but once, then closing in late
afternoon never to open again. Thriving in the clay loam
and gravelly soils of mountains and rocky ca&ntilde;ons in northern
Arizona and Nevada, ranging far up from five to seven
thousand feet, this hardy cactus will endure temperatures
even below zero without the slightest injury.</p>

<p class="tb">And now the borealis of desert color has passed us by in its
rush to the coolness and stillness of the desert night, only to
recuperate and renew its gay attire and appear in fresh array
of hue and tint in the morrow&rsquo;s pearly dawn. In ages long
gone by, when worlds were in the making, with the swish of
the eternal paintbrush the flowers received their colorings,
and it is with awe and admiration we have greeted these
colorful creations come forth at the touch of the Master
Artist; for we find them only here in the land of the burning
sun, where they are born to their lonely vigil under the sky
and stars, but to live and thrive and to fade and die, only to
reappear anon in eternal and varied expressions of the Infinite
Mind of Nature. Thus to-day passes into to-morrow, when
new fields are waiting to be painted on the glorious canvas of
the desert, and so we must take our leave of gorgeous bloom
and brilliant filigree alike, and hurry along as the setting sun
traces a last fiery pattern across the flaming heavens.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Prickly Pear Group or Nopals</span> (<i>Platopuntia</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how they grow</h4>
<p>These plants are large or small shrubs, consisting of several
jointed stems, the flat platelike joints or branches pear-shaped,
elongated, thorny, but not distinctly tubercled, the
clumps of joints from one to six or more feet in height, and
from two to ten or twelve feet across. Spicules, sometimes
called glochidia, are always present. The plants always
have scalelike leaves which soon fall off. The Prickly Pears,
like the Cholla, have spines of but one kind and of many different
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
sizes, but they are not fierce nor as dangerous as the
thorns of the Cholla, and they are never sheathed. The
flowers are symmetrical and very beautiful, among the most
brilliant of all the gorgeous cactus bloom, large flaming
orange or yellow blossoms, usually. They open in the forenoon
and close in the late afternoon of the same day, generally,
soon falling away from the young fruit. The latter
is covered with tubercles and always has spicules, scales, and
generally spines, is either fleshy or dry, and is edible, often
purple, falling away soon after maturity.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants grow readily from cuttings of one or two joints set
a few inches deep in moist sandy soil and given enough water
to keep the soil moist; the cut surfaces should be allowed to
dry thoroughly before planting. If mature cuttings are
used and planted in early spring, many species will blossom
the same season. Plants can be grown also from seeds
planted a half-inch deep in sandy soil out of doors or in
flats, with part shade and watered enough to keep the soil
moist but not wet; but these develop very slowly and remain
a long time in the soil before they germinate. All species
grow indoors or out, preferably in a southern exposure.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Papago Fruit Cactus</span> (<i>Opuntia Blakeana</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. William P. Blake, professor of geology in the University of Arizona and director of the College of Mines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p><i>Blakeana</i>, or the Papago Fruit Cactus, is formed by stems
a foot or so high which grow on the desert in clumps eight
feet or more in diameter. The branches or joints are pear-shaped,
about three inches wide and eight inches long, colored
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
a medium green suffused with beautiful purples. The
spicules and spines are very distinctive, the former growing
in fringes and easily dislodged. The spine colors are brown
or purple and tone off into gray, and the thorns are very
sharp and needlelike, dangerous when the plant is not handled
cautiously. The flowers&mdash;beautiful and also very showy,
from two to three inches long, bright satin-yellow with red-brown
centers&mdash;appear in April and May; the fruit ripens
in July and is of a pale pink-purple, quite sweet.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This species will grow outside and is not injured by temperatures
as low as twenty-five degrees below freezing.
With temperatures lower than this it should be protected
or grown indoors. Mature cuttings composed of one joint
planted at almost any season, but preferably early in spring,
with a half of the cutting covered, grow very readily. They
may be planted in any position or simply laid on the surface
of moist soil. Very little irrigation is necessary, but watering
once a month during the growing season is beneficial.
Grown indoors or out.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Delicate Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia delicata</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from its small size and delicate structure)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p><i>Delicata</i>, or the Delicate Prickly Pear, is formed by stems
three to ten inches long which are thin, wrinkled or dished
joints of bluish green and purplish tones. These joints or
stems are covered with bright yellowish spicules which seem
to be arranged in circular bundles, and with three twisted
spines one-fourth inch to three inches long, all three very
slender, delicate and whitish. The flowers are two or three
inches long and wide, of a bright satiny yellowish hue; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
fruit is pear-shaped and slender. This plant has small
joints, and with its long weak slender spines and large beautiful
flowers is a very attractive species. At the same time
it is quite a rare specimen of the Cactacea Family.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants grow indoors and out, and are not injured by temperatures
of twenty-five or thirty degrees below freezing.
With colder weather they require protection. They are
difficult to transplant on account of the fleshy spindle-shaped
roots, which decay if injured. Plants grow readily from the
cuttings of two joints or stems with the lower cutting covered
with soil, and prefer a sandy soil. They may be grown also
from seeds, but these germinate slowly. The <i>delicata</i>
thrives with moderate irrigation and should be watered once
a month during its growing season and given good drainage.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Purple Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia santa rita</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from the Santa Rita Mountains near Tucson, Arizona, in the vicinity of which it was discovered)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p><i>Santa rita</i>, or the Purple Prickly Pear, is a plant from two
to five feet tall composed of jointed compact stems, a foot
or less in length and half as wide, forming into a head. These
joints are a bluish gray suffused with purple tones and are circular.
This characteristic shape distinguishes the species from
the ordinary Prickly Pear, which has oblong or elongated
joints. The spicules form in a translucent yellowish fringe;
there are one or two twisted yellow spines, growing on many
specimens to three inches in length. The flowers are about
three inches long, and are very showy with their satiny
lemon-yellow colorings appearing in April and May. The
light green and purple fruit is elliptical. This plant is the
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
handsomest of all the southwestern Prickly Pears, while the
purplish circular joints with but a few slender spines make it
quite distinctive.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This variety is popular in cactus gardens and grows easily
from mature cuttings; if they are set in the ground early in
spring, the plants blossom during the same season. Half of
the cutting should be covered, and then the plant should be
watered lightly during the growing season to keep the soil
moist. The plant prefers gravelly or loamy soils. Fine symmetrical
plants are grown from seeds, though these germinate
slowly. This plant is not injured by zero temperatures,
and grows indoors or out.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Smooth Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia laevis</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(The specific name <i>laevis</i> means &ldquo;smooth&rdquo;)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Smooth Prickly Pear is practically devoid of the
spines so prevalent in the cactus family. Many specimens
reach a height of six feet; the joints or branches are from six
to twelve inches long and loosely branched from the base,
and are a yellowish green. The spicules are yellow and
brown or a mixture of these two colors, while the one or two
slender deflexed spines are white or tan. The flowers are
large and quite showy, and with their lemon-yellow petals and
orange centers present a very beautiful color scheme. The
bloom is about three inches long and as broad, blossoming
in April and May; the purple fruit ripens in July, and is about
the size of a large walnut; its flesh is pink fading into purple.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>These plants grow indoors or out and will endure temperatures
twenty-five or thirty degrees below freezing without
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
injury. Young plants may be transplanted at any season,
or mature cuttings may be planted early in spring. They
grow well in any ordinary soil, preferably gravelly loam or
rocky soil, and should be watered once a month to keep the
soil moist during the growing season. The seeds are slow
to germinate.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Foothill Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia Toumeyi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of James W. Toumey, former professor of botany at the University of Arizona)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Foothill Prickly Pear is another of the clump-growing
variety of the cactus clan, reaching to a height of about three
feet. The stems form readily in large clumps along the
foothills and low-lying mesas and swales in sunny exposures,
where the plants do best. This species has the usual system
of spicules and spines, the former a fourth-inch, the latter
about three inches long. The spicules are tawny or yellow
and brown, while the needlelike crooked spines are white
or a light red-brown. In the gathering shadows these thorns
give the plant a pinkish gray cast. The bright showy blossoms
are about the length and width of a teacup, are a bright
yellow with orange centers, and appear in April and May.
The elliptical purple fruit ripens in July.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants grow indoors and out and are not injured by thirty
degrees of frost, but require protection for temperatures
below zero. They grow easily from mature cuttings planted
at almost any season. Before planting, place cuttings in
shade for about two weeks to allow cut to heal. Cover about
half of the cutting with soil and plant in rocky or gravelly
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
clay; water lightly during the growing season and in droughty
periods.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Cow&rsquo;s Tongue; Lengua de Vaca</span> (<i>Opuntia linguiformis</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(All three names refer to the characteristic tongue-shaped joints)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Cow&rsquo;s Tongue is an oddly formed Prickly Pear which
grows tongue-shaped joints a foot to thirty inches long.
These flattened, tongue-shaped joints are about as wide as
a man&rsquo;s hand and a little thinner, covered with well spaced
spicules and spines. The edges of the joints are also fringed
with needlelike thorns which are dangerous to handle. These
light greenish stems or joints form into thickets growing
from three to five feet high and creating a very good hedge.
The spicules are a light yellowish; some of the spines are a
straw color, and it is to be noted that about half of them are
a pale purple and brown, not more than two inches long, the
spicules about half as long. The flowers are about the diameter
of a large cup and are very showy, of a beautiful satiny
yellowish hue. The fruit is light purple, the flesh greenish,
ripening in July.</p>
<p>This odd-looking cactus may be easily recognized among
all other Prickly Pears by its characteristic tongue-shaped
joints.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants are not injured in outdoor zero temperatures, but
for colder weather they should be covered or grown indoors.
They grow readily from cuttings set about six inches deep in
moist soil and watered lightly bi-weekly during the growing
season. Cuttings should remain out of the ground for two
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
weeks in shade before planting, to callus over the cut ends.
Almost any kind of soil will answer.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Discus Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia discata</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(The names refer to the disk-shaped joints)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Discus Prickly Pear, or <i>discata</i>, also grows in clumps
from three to five feet high and as much as ten feet across,
and has numerous ascending and spreading branches. This
plant, too, will make an excellent cactus hedge. Its spreading
branches are the disk-shaped joints of the stems, nearly
a foot in diameter and circular and platelike, of a pale blue-green
which in some lights is changeable. These disks are
covered with fringes of yellow and brown spicules, needlelike
and tough, and the edges also are fringed with them.
Placed among the spicules are three or four twisted stout
spines, white with yellow tips, and awl-shaped. The large
flowers are three or four inches long, and are very showy and
conspicuous with their bright satiny yellow tints. They
bloom in April and May, and the pear-shaped deep purple
fruit, three inches or so long, comes in July.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants grow outside and indoors, enduring zero temperatures
without injury. Plant mature cuttings of one joint
six inches deep in moist soil early in spring and water about
once a month to keep the soil lightly moist. They will grow
in almost any soil, but best in sandy loam. Plants also grow
from seed, but these are slow to germinate.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Engelmann&rsquo;s Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia Engelmannii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. George Engelmann, an early and outstanding student of cacti)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>Engelmann&rsquo;s Prickly Pear is a large spreading shrub six
to twelve feet in diameter growing to five feet in height,
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
with distinctive &ldquo;pancakelike&rdquo; greenish joints, about the size
of a medium-sized meat platter, but somewhat elliptical and
ascending from the base. The general color of this plant
is greenish. Its spicules are abundant in fringes along the
joints, colored orange-yellow or brownish, while the four
spines are awl-shaped with purplish and tawny yellow bodies,
and slightly banded. The brilliant satiny yellow flowers are
large and very showy. They have the curious characteristic
of changing to orange in the afternoon and orange-red
in the evening, and are a little less than five inches in width
and length. The plant blossoms in May and June, and the
pear-shaped purple fruit comes in July.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Treat cuttings in all respects as <i>Opuntia discata</i>. <i>Engelmannii</i>
are not injured by zero temperatures.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Long Spined Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia macrocentra</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(The name <i>macrocentra</i> refers to the long spines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Long Spined Prickly Pear is a plant about three feet
tall growing from stems which ascend from the base. These
joints are about the size of a man&rsquo;s hand, circular or egg-shaped,
and are of a dull olive-green suffused with purple,
sometimes purple throughout. This plant has a system of
spicules and spines arranged much in the usual cactus fashion.
The spicules are formed in bundles, generally crescent-shaped
and red-brown or tawny. The young spines are a deep red-purple,
while the older spines are often cross-banded, purple-brown,
reddish, or nearly black, three inches long, or longer,
fierce and needlelike and sometimes twisted. The flowers,
about three inches long and broad, are yellow with bright red
or orange-red centers which make them quite attractive.
The pink-purple fruit is elliptical and comes in July; the fruit-meat
is light greenish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants may be grown in zero temperatures without injury,
and thrive outdoors or indoors. They grow easily from
mature cuttings set out at almost any time, but preferably
early in spring; the cut should be allowed to callus over before
planting. They should be watered once a month or
so during the growing season to keep the soil slightly moist.
Gravelly clay soils are preferred, though the plants grow
well in sandy clay or loam.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Beaver Tail</span> (<i>Opuntia basilaris</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Beaver Tail, or <i>Opuntia basilaris</i>, gets both its common
and its specific name from the appearance of the joints
growing from the base, which are covered with spicules and
resemble a beaver&rsquo;s tail. This plant is usually about a foot
tall and two or three feet across the spread of the rosettelike
growth, with the fanlike or beaver-tail joints coming from the
bases. These joints are about six by nine inches and of a
blue-green suffused with purple and covered with fine white
hairs. The older joints become crosswise wrinkled. The
red-brown spicules are very abundant, short and easily dislodged.
There are no spines on the plant. The purple
flowers are very numerous, about three inches in width and
length. They appear in April and May, and the fruit, which
is covered with many fine hairs, comes in July.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants are uninjured by temperatures twenty-five degrees
below freezing. Transplant at any season; mature cuttings
planted early in spring will blossom the same season. Plants
may be set in gravelly or sandy soils with good drainage and
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
watered lightly once a month during the growing season or
droughty spells.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Golden Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia Covillei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. Frederick V. Coville, curator of the National Herbarium, Washington, D. C.)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p><i>Covillei</i>, or the Golden Prickly Pear, is a plant two to three
feet tall and three to four feet in diameter growing with ascending
or spreading branches in jointed form, which are
seven to ten inches long and four to six inches across. The
general color of the plant is pale blue-green. This plant
often forms in thickets during growth and is covered with
numerous brown spicules occurring in bundles or growing in a
fringe. There are about four spines of light brown and yellow
suffused with white, sharp and needlelike. The flowers
are very showy and of a bright golden color, about three
inches in length and width. The fruit is pear-shaped and
purple.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Transplant at any season, or grow from mature cuttings
planted five or six inches deep early in spring&mdash;they will then
blossom the same season. Water about once a month to
keep the soil slightly moist. Occasionally used in Southern
California as a hedge plant. Plants will endure twenty degrees
of frost without injury; for colder temperatures protection
is needed. Grown indoors or outside.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Flapjack Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia chlorotica</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(The name <i>chlorotica</i> refers to the light green coloring of the plant)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Flapjack Prickly Pear grows from three to six feet
high from short trunks but a few inches long. The branches
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
are erect, forming a rounded head which is quite attractive.
The upper joints look very much like &ldquo;flapjacks&rdquo; from six to
ten inches long and about as wide. The color of the plant is
light yellow-green with sometimes a blue-green cast. The
spicules are very conspicuous and are slender and very sharp,
about one-quarter inch long, of a translucent yellow and arranged
in a crescent form. The four or five spines are a
little longer than the spicules, sharp, slender, and bristlelike,
yellow and brown. The flowers are nearly three inches in
length and width, are light lemon-yellow with orange-red
centers, and blossom in May and June.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This Prickly Pear grows indoors or outside and is not injured
by temperatures twenty or twenty-five degrees below
freezing. It can be transplanted at any season. If mature
plants are transplanted early in spring they blossom the same
season. Cuttings do not root readily and sometimes remain
in the ground a year without growing. They should be
planted early in spring in sandy or gravelly clay loam; the
plants should be watered about once a month to insure good
growth.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Porcupine Prickly Pear</span> (<i>Opuntia hystricina</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from its long reddish or brownish spines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Porcupine Prickly Pear is formed of stems a foot or
so high covered with finely grooved spines, long and slender
and needlelike, up to four inches long, white and brownish
red. The spicules occur in a crescent-shaped mass of
light brown or yellowish colorings. The flowers are two
to three inches long and as broad. They are very showy
and bright purple or yellowish; they appear in April and
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
May, while the fruit ripens in July and August. The Porcupine
Prickly Pear grows at high altitudes and will endure
temperatures below zero without injury.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>A popular beauty in gardens, it grows readily from mature
cuttings planted at almost any season. If planted in early
spring, they should blossom the same season. The cuttings
should be dried off first to give the cut time to heal over,
planted in gravelly or loamy soil with about one-half of the
cutting covered, and watered once a month during the growing
season. The species may be grown also from seed in
flats or pots in moist soil with partial shade but with dry
air. The plants are not injured by temperatures of twenty-five
degrees below zero, and hence with proper soil, drainage,
and limited irrigation may be grown out of doors in
almost any part of the United States or of the temperate
zones.</p>

<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VI
<br />MINIATURE FORTRESSES ON THE DESERT</h2>
<p>Some of the first inhabitants of the plant kingdom to greet
the traveler approaching the desert from almost any direction
are most unfriendly, fierce, and strongly armored, as if
they would resist intrusion into their own special domain.
These fierce cacti are small fortresses of the desert. Out
there under burning-hot dry winds, where water is mighty
scarce, where the soil is pulverized rock or shale or wastes
of alkali sand, life at best is but little more than a fight to
survive against yearly drought, seasonal storm, and blazing
heat; even the bold woodpeckers, the rodents, and the sly
sand foxes play their part in this silent drama Nature stages
in the struggle for existence. Among the first greeters of
the desert are the Cholla members of the great genus <i>Opuntia</i>,
the fighters of the strange Fantastic Clan. Their flower
colorings are many and variegated, mostly beautiful yellows
and orange-yellows, purples, reds and browns, maroons,
orange-reds and lavenders; some species possess nearly all
colors of the spectrum and are veritable rainbows of tint and
hue, with the desert for a dark and picturesque setting. What
could be more beautiful than the desert rim with its towering
peaks unrolling into low vistas of <i>bajadas</i>, receding into still
lower valleys and swales, piled here and there with rocks of
volcanic outcroppings, and then the great splashes of Cholla
flowers with their brilliant patchwork of colorings stuck at
random on their drab, gray, somber, twisted, thornlike, armored
trunks? No artist has painted this glorious desert
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
canvas in all the gorgeous tints and hues, the wonderful shadings
and tones of the Great Builder&rsquo;s masterpiece, save One,
the Master Mind who conceived and created all.</p>
<h3>GROWTH</h3>
<p>Strange as it may seem, these fierce Cholla, called also
Cane Cacti, belong to the same genus, <i>Opuntia</i>, with the
Prickly Pears. These two groups form the two sections of
the genus <i>Opuntia</i>, the <i>Cylindropuntia</i> representing the
Cholla, the <i>Platopuntia</i> the Prickly Pears. One sees at a
glance that the latter name applies to our platelike &ldquo;flapjacks&rdquo;
of the desert, while the former name <i>Cylindropuntia</i>
applies to the Cholla section because the joints are cylindrical
and not flattened as in their cousin <i>Platopuntia</i>. &ldquo;Opuntia&rdquo;
is derived from the Greek town of Opus, where some
plant like the cactus is said to have existed; &ldquo;cholla&rdquo; (pronounced
ch&#333;lya, commonly choya) is of Spanish derivation
and means literally &ldquo;head.&rdquo; The name was given because a
large number of these fierce species form their branches into
broad rounded heads. The designation &ldquo;Cane Cacti&rdquo; is also
applied to the Cholla in allusion to their stems, from which
cactus canes are manufactured.</p>
<p>The two cousins in the same genus, so to speak, will be
found upon examination to differ greatly in several respects.
While the Prickly Pear is built up of thick or flattened platelike
joints which sometimes look like pancakes, with the
spicules and spikes growing from little clusters over the surface
(which by the way are most treacherous), the structure
of the Cholla is found to be cylindrical, with very prominent
tubercles. Since the Cholla is a very fascinating, mysterious,
and unique member of the great cactus clan it will be well
to be a little graphic in his description, for he is all that we
may say about him, and more. He has as a rule a short main
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
stem or trunk, from which branch many grotesque, weird-looking
arms and legs that cause the whole plant to resemble
a dwarf tree though it is typically shrubby in habit. A few
of these fantastic forms have the joints club-shaped, sometimes
quite slender, and these types are intermediate between
the Prickly Pears and the Cholla, growing mostly as
prostrate shrubs rather than as dwarfed trees. Prickly
Pears and Cane Cacti alike have only one kind of spines in
the areolas, though these are usually of several lengths, and
both bear spicules along with their thorns. In the Cholla the
tubercles are arranged spirally on the cylindrical joints, each
bearing an areola which in turn has the spines and spicules
and also the small, greatly reduced fleshy leaves half an inch
long or longer; these always wither and fall off in a few days,
showing no doubt that they are but remnants from an earlier
age, when possibly the prehistoric cactus bore much larger
leaves. Cholla thorns have very thin and transparent
sheaths, which persist unless destroyed or rubbed off, thus
differing from Prickly Pear thorns. Cholla spines are not
messengers of harmony, nor do they welcome the tenderfoot
tourist in his journey across the desert, for sheathed Cholla
thorns constitute the most treacherous and dangerous of the
cactus spines, a formidable fortress of strong, sharp, dangerously
recurved spikes; and woe to the careless stranger
who is inadvertently stabbed by one of these terrible Cholla
swords!</p>
<p>We have noted that the Prickly Pear blooms open in the
early morning, closing in late afternoon with one or two exceptions.
Among the very unusual Cane Cacti the opening
of the flowers seems to be on a sort of schedule, for we observe
that they unfold at different times, as at eight o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, at nine, at ten, at one o&rsquo;clock, at three, and at
four, then all close in the evening usually never to open
again. So if you are to see this phenomenon you will have
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
to be on time, for Cholla never wait. The flowers open
wide very quickly, in the course of fifteen or twenty minutes,
especially on bright sunshiny days. An occasional Cholla
may bloom for the second day, but this is a very uncommon
occurrence.</p>
<p>In speaking of the fruit of Cane Cacti we must tell you
that they, too, are very irregular and mysterious and fascinating
in their manner of growth; for the Cholla fruit are
different, and if you will but follow the fruit cycle you will
see that it is grotesque, irregular, and a phenomenon in itself.
Can you imagine fruit remaining on a tree for one year or for
several years, and for that matter as long as ten years at a
time, all hard, green, or ripe or juicy? This is what happens
on the Cholla dwarf trees. Most of the fruit stay on the
plants for a year or longer without spoiling or softening,
and will continue to remain for several seasons, ripe and
juicy and unchanged for long periods of time. The chain-store
idea did not originate in modern times by any means, for
ages ago Nature introduced this plan into her scheme of
things by implanting a very interesting peculiarity in some varieties
of the Cane Cacti, wherein new fruit and flowers grow
out from the ends of old ones or from the tips of old fruit,
and in such manner start a chain of some ten or twelve fruit,
all fresh, hard, green, or ripe, the first nine or ten years older
than the last, while the oldest will become larger, firmer, and
perhaps more woody but scarcely less succulent than the later
fruit.</p>
<p>Still another interesting phenomenon in the growth cycle
of the Cholla is the manner in which he grows on and on in
the process of evolution. In some varieties the fruit, falling
to the ground, develop roots and grow into new plants immediately,
while the seeds within remain unchanged and
do not germinate, though viable and capable of growth at
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
some later time. When the Cholla grows to maturity, he
sometimes reaches the height of fifteen or twenty feet, with a
large defiant trunk on which appear the fantastic arms full
of spicules and thorns that defy the intrusion of man, beast,
or bird. He is one of the first of the desert greeters to meet
the traveler coming to his habitat to get acquainted, and if
one arrives in fruit and flower time he will dress up in his
best array of color and will be found most interesting and
fascinating&mdash;if, of course, you keep your distance; for Cholla
will not tolerate any intimacy. When he is maturing and
getting along in years and the wind is gently blowing, he will
nod with little jumps of the lateral branches as if saying
&ldquo;Buenas noches&rdquo; or &ldquo;Adi&oacute;s, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; or more characteristically
&ldquo;Fuera!&rdquo; Begone! This seems to be his usual greeting,
and, the natives claim, has given him his unofficial title
of the &ldquo;Jumping Cholla.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>HABITATS</h3>
<p>Among the great groups of the cactus clan the Pincushion,
the Hedgehog, the Giant Sahuaro, and the Bisnaga, or Barrel
Cacti, have retreated before civilization. The first named
cannot endure close grazing of the ranges, nor trampling by
stock, nor being continually dug up and carried away from
their native habitats. They are rapidly disappearing from
their original haunts. This, notwithstanding the fact that
they are the most highly evolved of all cacti. The Giant
Cactus is too proud, too dignified to fight or to offer resistance;
only his size saves him from destruction. He reproduces
very slowly; from some areas he is clearly disappearing,
though in others he is making some progress. Before the inroads
of civilization, the Hedgehog and the Bisnaga (Barrel
Cacti) though strongly fortified are slowly receding, gradually
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
retreating from their far-flung outposts to their native
habitats, where they are better able to defend themselves.
Even their strong armor cannot withstand the attacks of man
in his efforts to convert them into sordid cash.</p>
<p>But the <i>Opuntia</i>, the Prickly Pears and the Cholla, advance
guards of the great cactus invasion from Mexico northward,
are the only members of the Fantastic Clan to withstand
the inroads of civilization and the only cacti that have
prospered and increased in numbers, notwithstanding man&rsquo;s
activities. Man has cut them down, and they have grown up
again in greater numbers; he has grazed them with his stock,
and they have spread over the prairies, mesas, foothills, and
<i>bajadas</i>; he has transplanted them to new environments and
transported them across the seas to new lands, and they have
driven him out of his own home and taken his fields away
from him, and have grown up to his very doorstep, almost
closing up his home. On the southwestern deserts his close
grazing of the ranges has made impossible prairie fires, the
great enemy of the cacti, and this has spread Prickly Pears
and Cholla over the ranges and carried them to the uttermost
parts of the desert, where they have taken root and created
new plants again. As a result of all this the Cholla have
increased a hundredfold on the deserts and foothills in less
than half a century, and in time they threaten to become a
menace to mankind.</p>
<p>The Cholla have never retreated before man. They thrive
on trampling and grazing by stock; unlike the Sahuaro or
Giant Cactus they are defiant and challenge man! They
elbow themselves in where they are not wanted. They ask
nothing from man and have little to give in return. With the
least disturbance they break into many pieces, each part becoming
a new plant. Not only the joints but also the fruit
of many varieties upon falling to the ground develop roots
and immediately grow anew. Drought has no ill effects on
them, for their supply of water will last for over a season.
Man and his domestic animals fear Cholla more than any
other plant on the desert! For their joints are easily dislodged
and the dangerous retrorsely barbed thorns are difficult
to remove from the flesh. They are cruel plants, for
many an innocent young animal becomes entangled in their
spiny meshes, and not being able to free himself dies a horrible
death. On the other hand they are veritable fortresses
on the desert and are a haven of refuge for such wild life
as the rattlesnake, the chuckwalla, an enormous lizard of
the desert, and the large cactus wren which lives practically
its whole life in the Cholla bush, where the female rears
her young in absolute safety and without danger of being
disturbed.</p>

<p>Cholla never relinquishes his right to land that he has acquired,
for when he dies of old age or even before that, a host
of young Cane Cacti, his children, spring up to take his place.
Thus it is that the Cholla prospers and multiplies in the face
of adversity, and even the hand of man cannot stay his progress.</p>
<p>Cholla and Prickly Pears have advanced farther north in
the great cactus invasion from Mexico than any other group
of cacti, and Prickly Pears have extended farther north than
Cholla. Vast areas in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and
even South Dakota are grown over with Prickly Pears; some
of these species have spread east to the Atlantic Ocean and
northward far into Canada, and it is said of one small species
that it has penetrated to within a short distance of the Arctic
Circle.</p>
<p class="tb">From Los Angeles during the early part of June we start
on yet another trek over the California-Arizona desert.
Have our long travel across the great amphitheater of the sun

<span class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
sunlight, our parched throats and fierce thirst for cool clear
springs of water, been worth our while, in the joy of new and
surprising finds, in the marvelous thrills, the awe and admiration
of beauty unsurpassed, in the wonderful changing kaleidoscope
of the brilliant painted desert? It must be that

ca&ntilde;on recesses, the lure of fantastic growth and wonderful
flower creations, the magical charm of the desert which never
stops its calling&mdash;the call that brings you back&mdash;as balancing
the scales and tipping them just far enough to bring us back
again for further exploration in the fantastic realm of cactus
land. And so we travel along.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">California Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia Parryi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California</i></p>
<p>The first member of the dangerous Cholla clan to greet
us is the California Cholla, growing in the interior arid valleys
of Southern California, seeking the gravelly or rocky
soils of mesa and ca&ntilde;on, and thriving along the lower mountain
levels. It is named in honor of Dr. C. C. Parry who
first collected it in 1851. The sharp stout thorns, a half-inch
to an inch or so long, yellow mellowing to brown with age and
covered with thin light yellow sheaths, appear in thick
spreading clusters over this two- to four-foot plant, forming
an impenetrable defense against animal or humankind. We
also note the dense semicircular mass of light-colored spicules,
a sixteenth- to an eighth-inch long, near the top of the
areola. The flowers, which have long since disappeared, are
generally yellow-green suffused with pink above, and the
petals are nearly an inch long, golden with light red tips.
The fruit becomes dry after ripening, and like many a
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Cholla fruit remains green upon the plant for a year or even
longer.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Desert Christmas Cactus</span> (<i>Opuntia leptocaulis</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California, Arizona, Texas, and Northern Mexico</i></p>
<p>The Desert Christmas Cactus is a flaming Cholla shrub
with its mass of bright red fruit in winter a brilliant sight on
the desert. The sprays of ripe fruit, sometimes used for
Christmas decoration, would undoubtedly be in great demand
were it not for the many fine reddish brown spicules which dry
and in falling become lodged in the clothing and flesh. One
of the writers has seen bushes on the desert several feet in
height, as one solid mass of brilliant carmine in winter, and
some of the ripe fruit stays on the plants practically all the
time. A very peculiar phenomenon has been observed from
time to time: a fruit or short branch will sometimes appear
growing directly out of another fruit on this fantastic <i>Opuntia
leptocaulis</i>, and thus Nature impregnates her seeming
freaks of fancy in thoughtful system and design upon these
strange Cactace&aelig;. This miniature fortress, <i>leptocaulis</i>, is
covered with sheathed Cholla thorns which are sharp and
pointed, tan with translucent yellow tips and loose whitish
sheaths. The inch-long flowers are pale yellowish or greenish
yellow, and these lazy blossoms have a bad habit of opening
their greenish yellow eyes at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
then closing their petals towards evening.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Buckhorn Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia acanthocarpa</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California, Western and Central Arizona, Southern Utah, Northern Mexico, and Southern Nevada</i></p>
<p>Fierce and thorny cacti are <i>Opuntia acanthocarpa</i>, sometimes
appearing on the broad desert land as dwarf trees four
to six feet tall, again growing as densely spiny shrubs, impregnable
fortresses defying man and beast. Over the arid sandy
or gravelly soils of the southwestern desert, this fierce
Cholla has fought his way and proved his right to existence,
asking nothing from the hand of man and having little to
give. Yet we cannot help admiring his sturdy race, their
courage and their challenge, standing up to man and even
laying down the law in some instances where they have spread
over the ranges, elbowing in unwanted and unasked, never
relinquishing to mankind their right to land they have once
acquired. &ldquo;Buckhorn Cholla&rdquo; is surely a good name for this
aggressive fellow. He has two dozen or so sharp red-brown
thorns only partly sheathed, greenish yellow blossoms a
couple of inches long, tipped with light red and suffused with
purplish tints, extremely spiny fruit which become dry at
maturity when they fall to the ground. The stems have each
a woody core or cylinder from which cactus canes are made to
some extent, but the species has no economic use and is regarded
as worthless on the range.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Golden Spined Jumping Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia Bigelovii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern and Western Arizona, Northern Sonora, Lower California, and Southern Nevada</i></p>
<p>We are approaching one of the hottest parts of the California
deserts, Death Valley, in search of perhaps the spiniest
and most dangerous of all the Cholla, the Golden Spined
Jumping Cholla. Four to eight feet tall, with numerous
stout fantastic arms seemingly pointed at each tenderfoot
tourist hurrying across the desert, like unholy messengers of
evil omen, this remarkable cactus is very conspicuous in its
rocky habitats. It grows luxuriantly in all the hottest locations
on our American desert, Coachella and Imperial valleys
in Southern California, southwestern Arizona, as well as here
before us in the sweltering heat of that great ca&ntilde;on so aptly
designated as our &ldquo;Death Valley&rdquo; of the Southland. With
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
his dense armor of interlocking thorns <i>Bigelovii</i> is immune to
grazing animals or rodents, nor is he injured by the extreme
heat or light of the hottest desert lands; all the spines, an
inch and a half long or longer, are light golden-yellow, glistening
in the brilliant sunlight of cactus land and easily recognized
from afar. Loose, papery, straw-colored sheaths
cover them and the stout sharp thorns are nearly always
broken off in a strong wind, or with the slightest disturbance,
and stick to one&rsquo;s clothing as readily as burrs; then once they
get lodged in the flesh are difficult and exceedingly painful to
extract. They form a golden shield for the lovely blossoms,
an inch or more in length, pale green or yellow-green suffused
with tints of purple. This member of the Cholla clan reproduces
himself very readily, for the loosely attached young
joints, falling to the ground, take root and grow into new
young plants. The Golden Spined Jumping Cholla and also
the common Jumping Cholla are sanctuaries where the desert
wren can build her nest and rear her young undisturbed
among the thorns; there, too, the chuckwalla, a large lizard,
can rest in peace, safe from attack of animal enemy and protected
from the burning heat and fierce desert winds that
sometimes sweep across the mesas and down the mountain
ca&ntilde;ons, in the great amphitheater of the sun.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Many Colored Tree Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia versicolor</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Western and Southern Arizona and Northern Mexico</i></p>
<p>A spectrum of coloring is <i>Opuntia versicolor</i>, with green or
dull purple joints, green-yellow, red, purple, or deep maroon
blossoms, not so very showy but a maze of tints and hues.
The countless flowers give the landscape a rich tone in April
and May, and the plants in their armament of mottled spines,
brown, gray, and purple, are a picturesque sight at any season.
The stems grow six to twelve feet tall, with a trunk two or
three feet high from which appear many fantastic arms intricately
branched to form a broad rounded head, five to ten
feet across. This dwarf tree is adequately protected from
the hot sun and animal marauder by sharp sheathed thorns
about a half-inch long, encasing its entire body in an impenetrable
suit of armor far more effective than any coat of mail
donned by warrior of old. The flowers cluster at the tips
of the brightly colored joints, which are two to ten inches
long; the small fruit remain green on the plant for about a
year. <i>Versicolor</i> is a good name for this bright Cholla since
it means &ldquo;variegated or diversified in color.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Popular Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia tetracantha</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>This slender little Cholla is interesting because of its inch-long
purple-brown and yellow flowers, unfolding once in the
afternoon, then closing at night never to open again. Many
of them seem to sulk on their heavy moisture-laden stems during
the hot dry hours of the desert day, and then swiftly to unfold
themselves and parade in evanescent beauty when the
long shadows of a departing day begin to paint the mountain
slopes, bidding the day to hurry and beckoning night to approach
for the fashion show of the desert flowers. <i>Tetracantha</i>
is a very popular addition to a cactus garden, and many
are the tourists who carry one or more of these smallest of
the Cholla back to their homes to preserve as relics from the
land of the burning sun. The bloom, yellow-green suffused
with purple, reminds one of a small old-fashioned dahlia;
May and June is blossoming time, and only a few minutes is
required for a flower to open in full. A rare and attractive
species is this matchless little beauty, spreading over the sandy
desert mesas and in gravelly or rocky foothills in southern
Arizona. The name <i>tetracantha</i> alludes to the four reddish
brown thorns enclosed in loose straw-colored sheaths.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Prolific Tree Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia arbuscula</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>This Cholla in southern Arizona is considered very valuable
as stock feed in time of drought. <i>Arbuscula</i> (the
name means &ldquo;a small tree&rdquo;) will produce from sixty to
seventy pounds of fruit in a season from one single tree, this
fruit remaining on the plant in good condition for over two
years; in fact if the trees are not grazed annually they break
down under their enormous loads of fruit. Like others of
this fantastic genus, the fruit upon falling to the ground develop
roots and grow into new plants; almost like the earthworm
in this habit, which if cut in two reproduces itself again
and again. Blossoms, also, are produced from the ends of
this prolific fruit of last season&rsquo;s growth, and the green and
yellow and red blooms grow, too, in dense clusters at the tips
of the gray-green joints. There is another color combination
to be seen in April or May when these glossy flowers come
forth into bloom, red-brown and orange-brown sepals and
petals appearing on bright green joints. The Papago Indians
prepare a most palatable salad from the young flower-buds
of this Cane Cactus. The unopened buds are gathered
and plunged into hot water for a few minutes, allowed to
dry in the sun and stored in ollas until winter; then they are
shaken in a sack or stirred briskly in a pan to dislodge the
fine spicules, cooked, and served with dressing, a tasty dish
served to the many tourists who travel across the desert
during vacation and pleasure time, in search of the various
new and interesting plant creations to be found in this fantastic
cactus land.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Thornber&rsquo;s Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia Thornberi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p><i>Opuntia Thornberi</i> is quite distinct among Cane Cacti in
having long tubercles and long angular joints, the latter a
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
foot to two feet in length. Two to four feet tall, this Cholla
covers the arid, sandy, or gravelly and rocky soils along the
foothills and broad desert mesas in south central Arizona, a
striking characteristic shrub, his fantastic arms irregularly
whorled and appearing angular because of the long, prominent
tubercles; the tri-colored flowers, yellow and green and
purple-red, nearly three inches in length, receive boundless
protection from the sharp sheathed thorns encircled with
bright bands of yellow-brown and tan. Though so beautifully
mottled, these are spines of which to beware. For so
cruel are the spikes of Cholla and so painful the process of removing
them from the flesh, if one is unfortunate enough to
become entangled in their meshes, that medical advice is to
leave the thorns in hand or body and allow them gradually
to work their way out, rather than to risk laceration by extraction.
<i>Opuntia Thornberi</i> has been described only very
recently; it is named in honor of Professor J. J. Thornber,
botanist of the University of Arizona and one of the authors
of this book, for his outstanding work on desert plants and
flowers.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Spiny Tree Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia spinosior</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Mexico, New Mexico, and Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>We go south into the rocky foothills and <i>bajadas</i> of Northern
Mexico, then up to altitudes from three to five thousand
feet to find this brilliant and beautiful cactus, the Spiny
Cholla, called also Tasajo by the natives; and given the specific
title of <i>spinosior</i>, meaning &ldquo;more spiny.&rdquo; Six to fifteen
feet, <i>spinosior</i> towers into the air, crowned by a brilliant
rainbow of color, the large lovely blooms, almost three inches
long and nearly as wide, clustering around the tips of his
thorny arms, bright harmonies of white, orange, red, copper
color, maroon, and shadings of purple, brown, pink, with
tints of lavender and brownish purple, a glorious color combination
among these largest of the Cholla blossoms, blooming
all through May and occasionally a month earlier; and
replaced in July by the light yellow fruit, which remains on
the trees for a year or even longer.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Jumping Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia fulgida</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Mexico and Southern Arizona</i></p>
<p>Along the highway in Northern Mexico here and there
dwarf trees appear, five to fifteen feet high, with stout woody
trunks branching quite near their bases into many spreading
candelabralike arms, covered with striking rose-purple bloom.
A handsome tree Cholla, <i>Opuntia fulgida</i> is called also the
&ldquo;Jumping Cholla&rdquo; from the sharp spiny joints which are very
loosely attached, so that one can scarcely walk among the
plants without some of the joints &ldquo;jumping forth&rdquo; as it were
and becoming attached to the clothing; a strong wind will
carry them, too, for some distance or the least disturbance
will dislodge them, and woe to the human or animal caught
by these cruel thorns; difficulty and extreme pain are experienced
in extracting a spine from the flesh, and it leaves its
mark behind, a wound which turns blackish and later a sickly
greenish hue. The pear-shaped young fruit and also flowers
grow from the tips of old fruit! thus forming broomlike
growths or chains of ten to fifteen fruit which remain on the
plants for several years unchanged, sometimes weighing two
or three hundred pounds. Fruit that fall to the ground grow
into new plants, as do the spiny joints.</p>
<p>The Jumping Cholla are among the most abundant and
characteristic Cane Cacti on the ranges of southern Arizona,
often excluding all other growth and spreading rapidly over
the broad grazing grounds. They are a beautiful sight on
the desert with their translucent white spines covered with
loose silvery sheaths glistening in the bright sunshine, and a
sight that will not easily be forgotten. The plants blossom
from June to September and in Mexico are known as &ldquo;Vela
de Cojote&rdquo; because of the shining spines; in the noonday rays
of the sun at a distance of a mile or more, a forest of these
plants on a hot day resembles a wavering, glistening white
sheet of light, because of the tremendous heat vibrations of
the vertical rays of the sun.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Northern Mexico, Southern Arizona, and New Mexico</i></p>
<p>Prostrate stems worming their way in impenetrable

Arizona and Northern Mexico, a creeping, crawling mass of
rough hairy spines and sheaths, stout sharp swords dangerous
and effective in harshly repulsing advance of animal or ignorant
human, is the Devil Cactus or Cursed Cholla, a veritable
fortress on the desert. A welcome retreat for small
rodents, snakes, and lizards, this terrible growth, <i>Opuntia

over the grazing lands and creating impenetrable areas dangerous
and worthless for stock. One shudders when he sees

<h3><span class="sc">Whipple&rsquo;s Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia Whipplei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Arizona, New Mexico, Western Colorado, and Southern Utah</i></p>
<p>One more of the fierce Cholla group must claim our attention,
bringing to a close our search for these cruel, relentless
growths, awful to contemplate in many instances yet strangely
enticing as well. It is a cultivated specimen of a low and typical
Cane Cactus which grows wild in northern Arizona, New
Mexico, and spreads north even into southern Utah and
Colorado, thriving at altitudes from five to seven thousand
feet in loamy soils of oak, juniper, and pine formations and
high grassy lands. This is the &ldquo;farthest north&rdquo; for a Cholla
to grow. One to two feet high, the shrubs form in rather
pretty clumps of silvery glossy slender spines, golden flowers
suffused with pink and green tinting, and purple joints on
greenish stems. A characteristic cactus of more northern
parts and named for Lieutenant A. W. Whipple, in charge
of the Whipple Expedition of 1853 and 1854. This ends
our long trek over sultry desert lands as we cross the boundary
line into southeastern Arizona at the customs in Nogales,
Mexico.</p>

<p class="tb">And so the greeters of the desert, advance guard of the
cactus invasion from Mexico, see us depart now for a time
from the mysterious land of the Fantastic Clan, wherein we
have learned of the charm of color, and the strange devices
of Nature in her scheme of Cholla growth; and where the
fierce, uninviting heat of the desert fails to keep us from entering
that domain of silence where the midday sun burns all
to a crisp under the relentless bombardment of its energy,
which after all gives alluring beauty to the wondrous cactus
flowers; and where the cooler shades of evening loose the mild
zephyrs that kiss our parched brows and gently lull us to sleep
at night with moonbeams playing at random among the
ca&ntilde;on shadows, gossamerlike and eerie in the ghostly light of
the stars. And once again in fancy we behold these armored
Cholla, silent fortresses of the desert, looming against the
mountain sides, with their beautiful rainbows of gorgeous
hue blossoming forth but to fade and die, never to appear
anew in their shimmering colorful sheens of glory against
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
background of sheaths and terrible thorns, the swords of the
fierce Cholla group.</p>
<p>Then comes the dawn. Slowly the eastern rim of the
landscape is bathed in soft pearly light, haloed over the
mountains. The night has passed and another day is on, and
we, too, have passed on and left the strange alluring land of
the weird Cholla group; but the beauty we have found out
there among fierce relentless growths lingers on in the background
of our conscious minds, and we wonder how it came
there and why it is; after all is it not part of the glory that
God has given us to use and to try to understand?</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Cholla Group, or Cane Cacti</span> (<i>Cylindropuntia</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how they grow</h4>
<p>The Cholla has a fierce armor of thorns, long and stout,
sharp and dangerous, a group of Cholla on the mesas comprising
a veritable fortress of the desert. These spines are
of one kind but of different sizes, and they are sheathed.
On account of their sheathed thorns the Cholla are the most
dangerous of all the cactus groups, and feared most of all
Cactace&aelig;. The spines vary from an inch or less to three
inches or more in length, and occasionally are half an inch
or more through. The stems of these species are cylindrical,
from a foot or less to fifteen feet tall, the branches generally
forming into a broad rounded head. They are not
ridged or fluted, but are covered with tubercles arranged
spirally. The plants are often grotesque and generally resemble
dwarf trees, though typically shrubby in habit. The
leaves are scalelike and soon fall off. Spicules are always
present, generally half an inch or so in length, easily dislodged,
so easily blown off by the wind that two species of
this genus are called &ldquo;Jumping Cholla.&rdquo; The flowers are
showy and very conspicuous, large, and of all colors of the
rainbow in many instances; opening and closing on the same
day and at different hours in different species, rarely appearing
the second day. A peculiar phenomenon is observed:
the flower buds sometimes grow out from mature fruit, thus
producing chains of fruit lasting for years. The fruit varies
in character and is found to be tubercled or smooth or shiny,
but always bearing the customary spicules. It is sometimes
dry, sometimes fleshy, often remaining unchanged and edible
for several years on the plants. Another curious fact is
that the fruits of many species when planted in soft moist soil,
or even falling to the ground, develop roots and grow into
new plants, the seeds within remaining viable and capable of
growth later on.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Most species grow readily from cuttings of one to several
joints set a few inches deep in sandy soil and given enough
water to keep the soil moist; it is better to allow the cut
surfaces time to dry before planting. Plants can be grown
also from seed planted a half-inch deep in sandy soil out of
doors or in flats, with part shade and watered enough to keep
the soil moist but not wet. Also, the fruits of many species
when planted in moist soil develop roots and grow into plants.
Cuttings or plants grow indoors or outside. A south exposure
is preferable.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">California Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia Parryi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. C. C. Parry, who first collected it in 1851)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The California Cholla is a very interesting and fascinating
plant and grows as several stems two to four feet tall,
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
branching from the base and quite erect. These stems are
cylindrical yellow-green joints six to twenty-four inches long
and an inch thick. They bear the usual cactuslike spicules
and spines. The spicules are a light yellow semicircular
mass, while the five to twenty sharp, slender needlelike spines
are crowded together, a half-inch to an inch long in many
instances. These are yellow but turn brown with age and
have thin light yellow sheaths. The flowers are yellow
tinged with red and are an inch or more in diameter and
length. The fruit is tubercled and very spiny, less than an
inch long, and has the peculiar characteristic of becoming
quite dry when ripe. This Cholla grows best in gravelly or
rocky soils in the hot interior valleys of Southern California.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Though not very attractive, this Cholla is occasionally
grown in cactus collections because of its rather fascinating
and peculiar characteristics noted above. Young plants may
be transplanted at any season; also the species can be grown
from cuttings and planted in the spring in moist soil. The
plants thrive in sandy or gravelly soil and may be given a
light irrigation once a month during droughty periods; they
grow inside or outdoors and are not injured by temperatures
twenty degrees below freezing.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Desert Christmas Cactus; Tasajillo</span> (<i>Opuntia leptocaulis</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p><i>Leptocaulis</i>, or the Desert Christmas Cactus, is a plant
growing as a dense low shrub only a foot high in many instances
with numerous stems or joints ascending from the
base, and in clumps three or four feet across. The little
joints are sometimes only an inch long, growing to four
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
inches in many cases, and are gray-green covered by numerous
brown spicules forming in bundles. One sharp, slender,
flattened, bent spine is present, a half-inch to two inches long,
with a tan body and a yellow tip, covered with a white sheath
which soon falls off. The flowers are a pale yellow and
quite small, while the fruit forms in clusters near the ends of
the branches, elliptical, about one inch long and scarlet. A
fantastic phenomenon is sometimes noticed in this species:
that of a branch growing directly out from a fruit.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Transplant at any season. Joints broken off and partly
covered with soil grow at once into new plants. Young
plants also grow quite easily from seed, and ripe fruit can
be gathered from the plant almost the year round. The
plant has a very wide distribution, grown indoors and out of
doors in almost any kind of soil with no care except to water
monthly during dry periods. It is not injured by temperatures
as low as zero, and with protection in winter can be
grown in much colder climates.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Buckhorn Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia acanthocarpa</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>acanthocarpa</i> from its very spiny fruit)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Buckhorn Cholla is a dwarf tree or shrub composed
of many stems ascending from the base and forming into a
compact head of dangerously thorny branches, very woody
in appearance. These branches or joints are four inches or
more in length, cylindrical and yellow-green. They are tubercled
and have a fringe of yellowish or red-brown spicules,
very short and sharp, and many loose clusters of fierce red-brown
thorns about an inch long, partly sheathed. The
flowers are two inches or more in length, greenish yellow with
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the tips suffused with red. The fruit is pear-shaped and very
thorny, and has the peculiarity noted quite often among
Cholla of becoming dry when fully ripe. This species bears
its fruit in June and July.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Young plants grow readily if set out in the spring in rocky
or gravelly soil with occasional watering to moisten the soil
until the plants become established. Cuttings grow quite
easily if planted in spring, and also the plant can be grown
from seed sown in sandy soil in pots or flats. This species
is not injured by a temperature of twenty degrees below freezing
and grows readily outside or indoors.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Golden Spined Jumping Cholla; Teddy Bear Cactus</span> (<i>Opuntia Bigelovii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for Dr. J. M. Bigelow, an early enthusiastic student of southwestern botany)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Golden Spined Jumping Cholla, or Teddy Bear
Cactus, is a very conspicuous and attractive plant among
the Cholla species, and is the spiniest of all this clan, growing
as high as twelve feet, and with a very tough stout main trunk
sometimes eight feet tall and three or four inches in diameter,
from which appear numerous ascending branches forming
a dense rounded head. The joints or branches are three to
six inches long and are yellow-green. There is a dense armor
of light golden-yellow spines, dark at their tips, eleven to
fifteen of them interlocking, an inch of more in length and
covered with paperlike sheaths which are somewhat loosely
placed. The spicules are straw-colored and appear in the
form of bundles. The flowers of this Cholla are borne at
the tips of the joints and are pale green suffused with purple.
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
The fruit is covered with tubercles or knobs and is yellowish
green. This plant grows best in the most arid parts of the
Southwest and in the hottest southern exposures of rocky
foothills and slopes.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Young plants may be transplanted at any season, or joints
may be planted in gravelly rocky soils. The plants should
be watered once a month during the growing season until
well established, after that less frequently. They will grow
indoors and out, and are not injured by a temperature of
twenty degrees below freezing. With colder temperatures
they require protection.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Many Colored Tree Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia versicolor</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from the many colors of its joints and flowers)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Many Colored Tree Cholla, or <i>Opuntia versicolor</i>,
grows as a main trunk two or three feet high, with many ascending
intricate branches which form a broad rounded head
from five to ten feet across at the widest part and six to twelve
feet high. The bark is coarse and fissured, gray or tan,
latterly scaling off. The joints or branches are from two to
ten inches long, are green or brown and tubercled. The
spicules form in a flattened mass and are yellow or brown.
The spines, five to fifteen, are awl-shaped and about three-fourths
of an inch long with brownish bases. The body is
of gray-brown or purplish hues covered with close-fitting
thin light yellowish sheaths. The flowers form in clusters
at the tips of the joints and are a yellow-green suffused with
red, pink, orange, or sometimes a deep maroon. The fruit
is also yellowish green suffused with purple and is pear-shaped.
Sometimes one fruit is found growing out from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
end of another on this fantastic growth, all fruit remaining
on the plant for a year or longer.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants may be transplanted at any season, or joints may
be planted in gravelly rocky soils. The plants should be
watered once a month during the growing season until well
established, after that less frequently. They will grow indoors
and out and are not injured by a temperature of twenty
degrees below freezing. With colder temperatures they require
protection.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Popular Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia tetracantha</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>tetracantha</i> from the four spines commonly present)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Popular Cholla is a loose irregular growth about four
feet tall with several stems coming from the base, but not
jointed. The brownish spicules are formed in bundles.
There are from one to four spines, all less than an inch long,
slender and stiff and brownish or light brownish gray, with
one spine longer and stouter than the others, and covered with
thin straw-colored sheaths. The flowers are of a pale yellow-green
suffused with purplish tints, and open in the afternoon.
The fruit is about one inch long and smooth, elliptical,
and orange-red.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This species may be transplanted at any season, or cuttings
may be planted early in spring, in sandy or gravelly soil and
watered monthly with light irrigation. The cuttings are less
certain to grow. Plants grow also quite readily from seed.
They are not injured by twenty-five degrees of frost and grow
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
outdoors or in; in colder weather than this they should be
given protection outside.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Prolific Tree Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia arbuscula</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(The name <i>arbuscula</i> means &ldquo;a small tree&rdquo;)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p><i>Arbuscula</i>, or the Prolific Tree Cholla, grows from three
to eight feet tall and has a short stout trunk three to six
inches in diameter. There are several branches which are
intricately arranged, forming a rounded head from six to ten
feet across; the gray-brown bark is coarse and fissured.
The branch-joints are from two to ten inches long or longer,
and are bright green. The light brownish spicules form as a
small tuft. Usually only one or two spines are present, sometimes
none at all, less than two inches long when they occur,
bent, slender, needlelike, and a dull straw or brown. The
thorns are covered with thin, amber, or brownish, loose,
translucent sheaths. The flowers are a greenish yellow suffused
with red and appear in dense clusters at the tips of the
joints; they are produced at the ends of last year&rsquo;s fruit.
This often forms a chainlike cycle. The fruit is bright green
and nearly smooth. This dwarf tree or shrub grows in the
sandy desert areas and flood plains of southern Arizona and
adjacent Mexico.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This cactus spreads from the roots. Young plants may
be planted at any season, or branches consisting of several
joints maybe planted early in spring; from these, plants grow
readily. Also the fleshy fruit develop roots and grow into
plants. They thrive best in heavy clay loam with light irrigation
once a month until well established. They are not
injured by a temperature of twenty-five degrees below freezing
and grow both outdoors and in; but with zero weather
they require protection.</p>

<h3><span class="sc">Thornber&rsquo;s Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia Thornberi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Professor J. J. Thornber, botanist of the University of Arizona and one of the authors of this book)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>Thornber&rsquo;s Cholla is a shrub growing from two to four
feet tall, with fantastic branches irregularly whorled and
long angular joints six to twenty-four inches in length and
yellowish green. It appears waxy, is densely covered with
long tubercles or knobs, and has short light-colored spicules.
The spines are three to twelve, one-quarter inch or less in
length, and very sharp. They are covered with thin straw-colored
or brownish yellow sheaths. The flowers of this
Cholla are of yellowish and red shadings, appearing mostly
at the tips of the branches. The fruit is quite dry when matured
and is distinctly tubercled.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Young plants may be set out at any season, also cuttings in
spring; they thrive best in rocky or gravelly soil, watered
once a month until the plants are established. They grow
outdoors or indoors and are not injured by twenty-five degrees
of freezing; but at zero they need protection.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Spiny Tree Cholla; Tasajo</span> (<i>Opuntia spinosior</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(The name <i>spinosior</i> means &ldquo;more spiny,&rdquo; referring to the many spines of the joints of this species)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Spiny Tree Cholla grows to a height of fifteen feet
and has a woody trunk several feet long with ascending
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
branches forming into a broad irregular open head, and with
tubercled joints three to nine inches long, which are set in
spiral rows. They are gray-green suffused with yellow and
purple. The straw-colored spicules are formed in bundles,
while the six to fifteen spines are gray suffused with pink or
brown; this produces a characteristic grayish pink coloring.
These thorns are covered with thin yellowish sheaths. The
flowers are very showy and appear in abundance at the tips of
the joints, which are three to nine inches in length. The fruit
is light yellow, broadly elliptical, tubercled and firm, with
thick walls, and it remains on the plant for a year or longer.
This Cholla grows in the rocky foothills and <i>bajadas</i> and in
the sandy desert areas of the southern part of New Mexico
and Arizona at fifteen hundred to five thousand feet.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Set out young plants at any season or plant cuttings in
spring in sandy or gravelly clay soil and water once a month
to keep the soil slightly moist until the plants are well established.
They grow very easily from cuttings. This Cholla
is not injured by zero temperature and grows well outdoors
or in the house; but with temperatures below zero it requires
protection.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Jumping Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia fulgida</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>fulgida</i> from the silvery sheathed spines, which glisten in the strong desert sunlight)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Jumping Cholla is a handsome dwarf tree growing
as high as fifteen feet, deeply fissured, with a stout woody
trunk as much as four feet long, and with candelabralike
branches of blackish or brownish bark. These branches
form the broadly rounded head of the tree. The joints are
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
three to six inches long, succulent and easily broken off, and
covered with tubercles in a spiral arrangement. The spicules
are white and are formed in tufts, while the spines, seven
to thirteen, are usually bent and less than two inches long.
They are slender and needlelike with loose papery sheaths,
silvery-white and glistening, giving the species its specific
name. The flowers are of a bright rose-purple with yellow
and pinkish tinges. The fruit is pear-shaped and green.
It will be noted that both the fruit and the flowers grow out
from the tips of old fruit, thus forming chains of ten to
fifteen fruit. The Jumping Cholla grows well in sandy or
gravelly clay soils in the low rocky foothills of southern
Arizona and Northern Mexico.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plants can be transplanted at any season, or the joints or
even fruit may be planted or laid on the surface of the
ground, covered partly with soil and watered occasionally,
whereupon they grow into new plants, making a few inches&rsquo;
growth the first season. Plants grow best in clay or gravelly
clay soil and may be given light irrigation monthly until well
established. They are not injured by temperatures of
twenty or twenty-five degrees below freezing, and grow indoors
and out; in zero weather they require protection.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Cursed Cholla; Devil Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia Stanlyi</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named for J. M. Stanly, artist of the Mexican Boundary Survey)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Cursed Cholla, or Devil Cholla, is very appropriately
named. Plants grow with prostrate and creeping stems,
forming impenetrable masses several feet across. The stems
are from a common center with the tips ascending, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
joints, which are as much as six inches long, are club-shaped
and tubercled. The spines are very numerous and stout,
also very sharp and swordlike, and will cause grief unless
one is very careful. They grow a little more than two inches
long, are a light yellow, and have short sheaths over their
tips. The flowers are about three inches long and are
yellow, and the fruit, which is club-shaped and about three
inches long, is covered with white cottony hairs and needlelike
spicules. These plants grow in the sandy soils of the
desert areas of southern New Mexico and southern Arizona
and adjacent old Mexico.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Either prostrate rooted stems or joints planted at any
season grow into plants. The seed sown in moist sandy soil
grow easily. The plants grow in sandy or gravelly clay
soils and should be watered monthly until well established.
Temperatures as low as zero do not injure the plants, but
with lower temperatures they should be protected. They
grow outdoors or indoors.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Whipple&rsquo;s Cholla</span> (<i>Opuntia Whipplei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named after Lieutenant Whipple, in charge of the Whipple Expedition of 1853 and 1854)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>Whipple&rsquo;s Cholla grows farther north than any other
species of Cholla, and reaches three feet in height, composed
of several stems that form a low compact clump. The joints
are two to ten inches long, are a light green suffused with
purple, and are covered with tubercles arranged in spirals.
The tan spicules are very short, about an eighth of an inch
long and appear in tufts. The two to five spines are a half-inch
to an inch long, one of them longer than the others.
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
The thorns have yellowish tips and light red-brown bodies
covered with loose papery sheaths of a silvery sheen. The
beautiful yellow flowers are very showy, about two inches
long, appearing from April to June; the fruit is about two
inches long with prominent tubercles. <i>Whipplei</i> grows in
northern Arizona, southern Utah, New Mexico, and western
Colorado, and will be found in loamy, gravelly soils in oak,
juniper, pine, and prairie-grass lands between altitudes of
five and seven thousand feet.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Transplant rooted plants at any season. Cuttings or
joints may be planted in the spring in sandy or clay loam,
and given enough water to keep the soil moderately moist.
This Cholla endures weather twenty-five degrees below zero
without, injury and hence may be grown in cactus gardens
over a large part of our country both out of doors and
in the house. It is an attractive cactus and well worth
cultivation.</p>

<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER VII
<br />A DESERT GRAVEYARD</h2>
<p>In the blue ending of a desert day with the sun in the setting
and the somber shadows creeping over the desert hills
and down into the lowlands and swales, we would if we could
build a dream-city story of a ghostly desert village, spectral
and silent and lonely with only the dismal howl of the coyote
to punctuate our tale. Since we are on a trek into the forbidden
land of thorns and spikes and spines, we have but to add
the Song of the Desert and the setting of our story is
complete.</p>
<p>It is near the sunset time, when the cooling of the desert
wind begins and we can view the horizon pierced by the distant
mountains and perhaps the many trees on the mountain
slopes, while out on the mesas and down in the valleys Nature
has painted the floor of the desert with lacework of many
kinds of brush, filigree of strange fantastic plants, tall and
shaftlike or sinuous and creepy, covered with countless spikes
and thorns, armed with innumerable spines or darts; all this
is the desert, hot and dry and dusty by day, delightfully cool
and alluring when the sun has gone and the moonbeams flit
about among the strangely weird fantastic clan. It is the
beckoning call to spend the twilight in meditation and rest,
and then to sleep in comfort. Here then is the amphitheater
of the sun, and ere the Goddess of Night bids adieu to the
day, she takes up her baton and the music of a soft desert
night begins. It comes rushing in over yonder rim of mountain
peaks and down through the trees with a great crescendo
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
till it reaches the mesas and valleys. Then lightly, gently,
comes the fading diminuendo, dimming the tones of the
desert song, faintly and sweetly with the swish of the evening
zephyrs, and the land of the cacti is again at peace.</p>
<p>We are once more on our way to the desert land of flower
mysteries and weird plant phenomena. Along the dusty
highway one may notice from time to time many curious-looking
mounds which seem almost like monuments standing
out in the great alone, in silent eulogy to some departed
world perhaps. In the hot dry heat of a desert day they
are just some more of Nature&rsquo;s plants and flowers, but in
the dusk of the desert twilight these fantastic growths look
like some immense graveyard, and we might fancy that we
can even read the epitaphs on their beautiful spiny shafts.
For in this fancied graveyard of the desert there are many
wonders, and now we shall invade their tomblike resting
place and get acquainted with still another group of the
weird Fantastic Clan. This is the Visnaga Cactus or Bisnaga,
meaning &ldquo;barrel,&rdquo; commonly known as the Barrel Cactus,
friend of the Indian or the lost traveler on the desert.
Science gives him the name <i>Echinocactus</i> (derived from the
Greek <i>echinos</i>, &ldquo;hedgehog,&rdquo; and <i>kaktos</i>, a kind of spiny
plant) followed by some less pretentious appendage to denote
his species.</p>
<h3>GROWTH AND HABITATS</h3>
<p>The genus <i>Echinocactus</i> is thought to have originated on
the great arid plateaus of Mexico and to have extended northward
to the southwestern borders of the United States,
where as many as forty species are known to grow. The
group is a large one, including as many as one hundred forty
species in the two countries where they are most abundant.
There are no varieties in Central America, but a number in
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the driest parts of South America, thriving always in the
gravelly or stony soils along the foothills and <i>bajadas</i> and
out on the broad desert mesas. The plants are globular or
cylindric and strongly ribbed with sharp stout thorns, suggesting
at once a barrel in size and shape, with its numerous
nails protruding from the circular staves. They grow
singly or in groups of two to four or more, from a foot to
three or four feet in height, sometimes reaching nine feet.
The central spines are the strongest and stoutest, usually
one or more hooked, the radial spines also stout; the radial
bristles or threads if present are at times rather firm and
sometimes quite weak in texture. The <i>Echinocacti</i> have no
spines on the ovaries or fruit&mdash;a characteristic which differentiates
them from the <i>Echinocereus</i> Cactus.</p>
<p>In this great field of Bisnaga, the Barrel Cacti, or Visnagita,
the little fellows, we have selected about fifteen typical
species although there are many other varieties. It is early
in the morning of a hot June day in southeastern Arizona
that we start on our sixth and last trek across the desert,
armed with notebooks and other paraphernalia of the student
or tourist, having selected our locale late the preceding day.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Interlacing Spine Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus intertextus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern Arizona, Southwestern Texas, and Northern Mexico</i></p>
<p><i>Echinocactus intertextus</i>, the Interlacing Spine Cactus,
signals our attention first, a rare and brightly flowered little
fellow. It is interesting to note that the name <i>intertextus</i>
refers to the numerous radial interlacing spines covering
this Visnagita in two or three whorls, and on the older plants
forming a dense lacework over the entire plant. Only an
inch and a half tall in many cases, sometimes reaching the
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
height of six inches, his stems are deeply ridged in spirals a
half-inch or so apart, of a dull green or yellow-green and
scurfy. The thorns are stout and awl-shaped, abruptly
pointed, and translucent pink-yellow with darker tips, becoming
dull gray or black near the base of the plant; twenty
or thirty spines radiating like the spokes of a wheel and
interlocking with others, four or five centrals, dull gray with
reddish brown tips. <i>Intertextus</i> thrives in rocky, gravelly
soils at altitudes of four or five thousand feet; his bright and
beautiful bloom may be glimpsed from quite a distance, light
purplish flowers with yellow stamens, growing in clusters near
the centers or tops of the stems. The blossoms of <i>Echinocactus</i>
nearly always appear in a circle around the head of
the plant, just above the young spine-bearing areolas, the
flowers continuing to develop on the inside of the circle in
areolas that are continuously forming by further growth
of the plant.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Purple Spined Visnagita</span> (<i>Echinocactus erectocentrus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern Arizona</i></p>
<p>Purple Spined Visnagita is a gayly tinted beauty which
grows only in limited areas. Indeed not only is it rare and
beautiful but the species is fast disappearing; indicative perhaps
that Nature in her wise prescience of coming events is
already taking care of the problem of overproduction. The
flowers are white or flesh-color diffused with pink, most delicately
shaded sometimes with a hint of lavender, and are very
lovely and fragrant though they do not open fully; they
come in clusters surmounting the stem, opening in the forenoon
and closing in the afternoon, for four or five days in
April and May. It is not strange that the deeper-tinted
blossoms appear on the plants with the more brightly hued
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
spines. The latter form a dense, almost impenetrable coat
over the entire plant, giving a dull rose-purple effect which
can be seen unmistakably for two or three hundred feet or
farther in its arid rocky habitat. Purple Spined Visnagita
is much in demand by collectors, being easily recognized at a
distance by the eighteen or so brightly colored thorns; because
of these gayly hued spines it is one of the handsomest
of all our smaller cacti, sometimes compared to that beautiful
splash of color, the Rainbow Cactus, near which it is
often found growing.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Traveler&rsquo;s Friend</span> (<i>Echinocactus Covillei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern and Western Arizona, and Sonora</i></p>
<p>The Traveler&rsquo;s Friend! This name sounds rather interesting,
and upon examination <i>Echinocactus Covillei</i> is
found to merit his friendly title. If one gingerly cuts off
the top of the plant, crushing the fleshy part into a pulpy
mass with a handy stick, cool refreshing water is revealed,
fit for drinking and sufficient for one person. This Bisnaga
has proven a good friend to the desert wanderer, but it is
Nature, the marvelous architect, who is our real friend, by
providing an ingenious structure which enables this cactus
to store water in its fleshy-ribbed stems which grow from one
to five feet tall and a foot or so in diameter; thereby permitting
it to thrive and blossom in the terrible heat of the desert,
and during the long, long seasons of drought to save many
an Indian and other desert traveler from dying of starvation
or thirst out on the broad mesas in this land of blazing sunlight.
Also, if you are in cactus country and should ever
become lost on the desert, look for <i>Covillei</i>, for he always
leans toward the southwest and when other signs fail you
can depend upon him to guide you in the right direction.
Many a lost Indian or Mexican has obtained water and directions
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
from <i>Covillei</i>, the Traveler&rsquo;s Compass, and thus
has saved his life through knowledge of desert lore, while a
stranger schooled in books but lacking the wisdom which
comes from long association with desert life could easily
lose himself in the arid wastes, only to perish anon.</p>
<p>This Traveler&rsquo;s Friend is a handsome fellow; the crimson
and orange-red hues of the brilliant blossoms shade into
the yellow and purple-red tints of the style and its branches,
harmonizing with eight or nine pink and reddish spines and
their translucent yellow tips, a splash of gay rainbow hues
against the drab background of rocky, gravelly soil along
the foothills of southern and western Arizona and out on
the mesas of Northern Mexico. In old Mexico the natives
still utilize this Bisnaga by making from it the delicious cactus
candy which is so prized by tourists, and seized upon with
delight as one of their first discoveries in the land of the
cactus clan.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Turk&rsquo;s Head</span> (<i>Echinocactus horizonthalonius</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona, Northern Mexico, and Western Texas</i></p>
<p>This species grows sparingly in arid, rocky, or stony soil
of slopes and hillsides from western Texas to southern Arizona
and adjacent Mexico. It differs from others of its kind
in the coloring of the blossoms, which are the most delicately
tinted of all the cactus flowers, pale rose to deep pink suffused
with lavender hues, and in the light blue-green of the stems,
which are nearly a foot high and about half as wide; also in
the spiny characteristics, the stout twisted, awl-shaped thorns
converging toward the tip of the plant. The flowers are
large for the species, two and one-half inches long or more
and nearly as broad when fully open, blossoming for but one
day and only in the very brightest of sunshine. <i>Horizonthalonius</i>
looks quite like a Turk&rsquo;s head when in flower, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
the pinkish purple tassel at the tip of his head in a dense mass
of long, tangled, cream-white wool.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Candy Barrel Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus Wislizeni</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern Arizona, Northern Mexico, and Western Texas</i></p>
<p>The stems of this peculiar growth are used largely in making
the highly priced cactus candy, the fleshy part sliced and
soaked in water overnight, then cooked until tender in a
strong sugar solution and allowed to harden and crystallize.
A most tasty delicacy is produced which is sold all over the
world as &ldquo;cactus candy,&rdquo; and so popular is this rare sweet
both in the East and abroad as well as among tourists to
the desert that the industry threatens to eradicate <i>Wislizeni</i>
and several other species of the Barrel Cacti. &ldquo;Nigger
Head&rdquo; is another designation for the Candy Barrel Cactus,
since this unique desert growth with its fringe of a dozen or
so needlelike bristles resembles an affrighted southern &ldquo;nigger&rdquo;
with his hair all standing on end. The young plants
are globose and the older ones cylindric, from one to seven
feet tall and a foot or two in diameter; the threadlike bristles
are light gray and resemble an insect&rsquo;s antenn&aelig;, the four or
five stout central thorns rose-pink and yellowish mottled, the
lower one longest and strongly hooked, one to five inches
long. <i>Ferocactus Wislizeni</i> or Fishhook Cactus, as this
Bisnaga is also called, is one of the most striking cacti of the
desert areas, and its presence always inspires considerable interest;
the spines are densely fine hairy, a characteristic
rarely noted among cacti.</p>
<p>The Candy Cactus, also, goes under the name of &ldquo;Traveler&rsquo;s
Friend&rdquo; or &ldquo;Compass Cactus,&rdquo; and like <i>Covillei</i> it invariably
leans toward the southwest and will direct aright
a lost traveler who is versed in desert lore and can read the
signs of the land. Then too, if the top of stem or trunk is removed
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
with a sharp knife or machete and the fleshy part is
crushed, or pommeled into a pulp, a considerable amount of
water can be secured for drinking from this friendly cactus,
which though a little saline and not very palatable is a life-saver
in time of stress. <i>Wislizeni</i> grows well in the sandy
loamy clay soils of the desert <i>bajadas</i> and along the foothills.
The name of the species honors Dr. A. Wislizenus, who was
in charge of a botanical expedition to the Southwest in 1848.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Nigger Head</span> (<i>Echinocactus Le Contei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Western Arizona, Southern Utah, Southern Nevada, Southern California, Lower California, and Sonora</i></p>
<p>This species, also, is given the name &ldquo;Nigger Head&rdquo; because
the spines and bristles are curled and bent down closely
against its trunk like a &ldquo;nigger&rsquo;s head&rdquo; with coarse curly
hair. To be sure, one never has seen a negro with pink hair,
but this Nigger Head Cactus has a coat of interlocking
densely fine hairy spines of lovely pink and mottled rose
shades, some pointing upward, some downward, some laterally,
and a fringe of ten to fourteen grayish threadlike radial
bristles; such an impenetrable coat affords much-needed protection
against heat and cold, and hungry rodents or range
animals. <i>Echinocactus Le Contei</i> is among the most attractive
of the Barrel group with its bright roseate spines, and
its deep yellow blossoms with purple-red centers, creating
the impression of a purple bloom within an orange-red flower.
The flowers come forth in April and May, the fruit matures
in July. The plant grows nearly always on a single stem,
rarely two or more in a clump, from one to seven feet tall
and about eighteen inches in diameter, with twenty to twenty-four
ridges encircling trunk and stems. The latter are
utilized by Mexicans and Indians for the making of cactus
candy.</p>

by scientists to attain the age of a thousand years!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>This growth was named by scientists for Dr. John Le
Conte, who discovered it in the lower Gila River country of
Arizona. It is a very interesting specimen and has the
following names, any and all of which seem to fit: <i>Echinocactus
Le Contei</i>, <i>Ferocactus Le Contei</i>, Barrel Cactus, Nigger
Head Cactus, and Candy Cactus. It prefers the arid
rocky or gravelly desert lands, <i>bajadas</i> and foothill slopes,
and seeks always the hottest exposures with very little
rainfall.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Pink Flowered Visnagita</span> (<i>Echinocactus Johnsonii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Eastern California, Northwestern Arizona, Western Utah, and Southern Nevada</i></p>
<p>This very attractive and interesting Visnagita rarely grows
in any abundance. It is quite outstanding because of its symphony
of color radiating rose and gray and purple hues from
the thorns, and the large deep pink blooms two and one-half
inches long and broad, bell-shaped panicles clustering in a
mass of cream-white hairs. The erect ascending spines grow
straight or slightly curved, in dense layers, and sharp.
<i>Johnsonii</i> likes the sunny exposures and seeks the arid rocky
or gravelly soils. The species is named for Joseph Ellis
Johnson, an amateur botanist of southern Utah.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Golden Spined Barrel Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus Rostii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern California, Western Arizona, and Lower California</i></p>
<p><i>Echinocactus Rostii</i>, or the beautiful Golden Spined Barrel
Cactus, with its bright yellow stamens and petals tinged with
red, when in bloom, and the striking golden-yellow spines,
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
appears at a distance like a bundle of straw. The flowers,
an inch or so long and about as broad, are borne in a circle
clustering around the tops of the stems, which grow singly or
in clumps of two to ten, four to nine feet high according to
age; the spine clusters are about an inch apart, golden and
straw-yellow suffused with pink near the bases, sometimes
pink banded with the tips growing straight or curved, all
spines very fine hairy. The species is named for E. P. Rost,
who discovered it, and is found in a very restricted area
among the arid, gravelly or rocky foothills and <i>bajadas</i> or
mesalike mountain slopes and ca&ntilde;ons. The plant is a striking
object against the landscape in its dense spiny armament,
rendered impenetrable by the beautifully mottled stout spines
extending in every direction; then in April come the golden
blossoms encircling the tips of the stems in a flashing aureole
of light.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">California Barrel Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus acanthodes</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern California, Lower California, and Southern Nevada</i></p>
<p>The California Barrel Cactus, <i>Echinocactus acanthodes</i>,
grows in arid, gravelly or rocky foothills and arroyos on
the deserts of southeastern California in the Imperial Valley,
and in northern Lower California. This species grew formerly
in great abundance on the rocky, gravelly mesas of the
Coachella Desert near Palm Springs, California; now, however,
many of the fine large specimens have been removed,
and the sticky pulp of the stems utilized for cactus candy
manufacture. The name <i>acanthodes</i> refers to its many
spines, a gray-yellow fringe of seven or eight stout needlelike
bristles, and eight or nine pink and yellow banded radial
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and central thorns one to two inches long, the lowest one
sharply hooked. The plants grow nine feet tall at times,
occasionally only a foot or so in height, generally with single
stems seven to twelve inches in diameter according to age;
the flowers are bell-shaped, blossoms of rare beauty giving
a lovely golden cast to the landscape in April and May; the
fruit is borne in a circle of greenish yellow suffused with
purple, around the tops of the stems, and matures in July.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Many Hooked Visnagita</span> (<i>Echinocactus polyancistrus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southeastern California, Western Arizona, and Southern Nevada</i></p>
<p>The meaning of <i>polyancistrus</i> is &ldquo;many fishhooks&rdquo;; but
why should there be fishhooks on the desert? <i>Echinocactus
polyancistrus</i> is a very interesting and showy Visnagita growing
on mesas and deserts; though widely distributed, it never
appears in abundance, and is rather rare. It is densely and
conspicuously spiny, covered with sharp needlelike thorns
placed radially, a half-inch long or longer, dangerously
hooked, spreading, and very formidable; resembling the
common fishhook and far more fearful. This cactus is
most conspicuous and attractive in its white shining armor
of spines. The blossoms are large and showy and remain
open for several days. At first rose-purple, they change
to a deep crimson, while the throat of the flower is broad
and covered with yellow stamens; the styles are bright red,
and even the mature fruit is a brilliant red. The flowers
grow in clusters from near the tops of the plants and create
a splash of fiery crimson over the mesas, beautiful to behold,
flaming against the dark background of mesquite and sagebrush
and other desert cacti.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<h3><span class="sc">Green Stemmed Visnaga</span> (<i>Echinocactus viridescens</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California and Lower California</i></p>
<p><i>Echinocactus viridescens</i> is a small Bisnaga growing in the
vicinity of San Diego, California, and is found along the
beaches there, and in the dry ridges and hills of Lower
California. It gets its name from the greenish flowers and
stems (<i>viridescens</i> is Latin for &ldquo;growing green&rdquo;). The
stems grow a little over a foot high; the numerous stout
sharp thorns are finely hairy, encircling the plants in red and
yellow and rose-pink bands of coloring; while the blossoms
form a bright halo of gold and purple tints around their
tips, the margins of petals and sepals yellow and the thickened
midribs yellow or purple-red, the whole producing a
strongly greenish cast in flower and plant. The fruit can
be eaten, and has a slightly acid taste like that of the common
gooseberry.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Harem Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus polycephalus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Southern California, Western Arizona, Nevada, and Utah</i></p>
<p>The many-headed Barrel Cacti are composed of the older
stems, a couple of feet or so in height, each surrounded by
twenty to forty smaller ones, and we might give this group
the name &ldquo;Harem Cactus.&rdquo; These many-stemmed Barrel
Cacti form large hemispherical mounds three to five feet
across with the largest stems or trunks in the center. Hence
the suggestion of an old man and his many wives; hence also
the designation &ldquo;Mound Cactus.&rdquo; The group thrives well
on stony and gravelly hills of our hottest southwestern deserts
where the rainfall is three inches or less. Clad in an
impenetrable armor of silver-gray spikes and spines, banded
in pink and pinkish gray zones of color and in a densely fine
fuzzy growth, <i>polycephalus</i> blossoms in many showy attractive
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
blooms, bright yellow petals and stamens in striking
contrast to the purple-red sepals and scales. The clusters
of flowers are hidden among the dense masses of stout ascending
or incurved spines and rarely open in full, both fruit
and blossoms deriving protection against the ravages of sun
and storm, rodents and other desert animals from their
strong armament of thorns and spikes. This cactus is interesting
because it is so different from any of its relatives.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Mexican Fruit Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus hamatacanthus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Mexico, Southern Texas, and New Mexico</i></p>
<p>This quite odd little Barrel Cactus is highly prized by the
Mexicans and Indians who know it for its fine fruit, which is
slender, two or three inches long, and very sweet with many
dark brown seeds. The ripe fruit gradually dries, and is
eaten as a sweetmeat without any sort of treatment; firm and
sweet and very sugary, it is considered a rare delicacy by
the hundreds of thousands of tourists who journey to the
Southwest in quest of unique desert growths. It is used very
largely as a food product by the natives; from the appearance
of the thorns the species is named <i>hamatacanthus</i>
(&ldquo;hooked spine&rdquo;). We note that the flowers are rather
large, about three inches long and two inches or more across,
golden or yellow suffused with red, and appear in clusters at
the ends of the stems, which are generally two or three feet

<h3><span class="sc">Mexican Lime Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus Pringlei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Central Mexico</i> (<i>Coahuila</i>)</p>
<p>And here is the Mexican Lime Cactus, which is used for
a refreshing drink that is similar to the well-known limeade,
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and often called the Lemonade Cactus. A little Mexican
cactus juice, some sugar and ice-water, a hot day, and you
have a cool delightful drink. This species is made striking
by its great size, mature plants reaching a height of nine feet,
with several stems forming in clumps or growing singly, and
by the light red hooked spines which give the stems a reddish
coloring when seen at a distance. The blossoms are group
flowers of orange-yellow, having the appearance of red on
the outside and golden within, and clustering in a circle
around the tops of the stems. This fine Fruit Cactus is
native to the foothills and mountains of Central Mexico in
the Mexican states of Coahuila and Zacatecas.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Giant Visnaga</span> (<i>Echinocactus visnaga</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Central Mexico</i> (<i>San Luis Potos&iacute;</i>)</p>
<p>It is late on a sultry day in June and we are speeding along
the dusty highways of Central Mexico, intent on our quest
for a certain queer specimen of the weird Fantastic Clan,
when the long low shadows of the afternoon begin to slant
over the singular cactus growths for which we have been
searching, and the blue haze of a waning day is seen to gather
over the distant mountains. We pause in our hurried flight
across the Mexican <i>bajadas</i>, as a strange and lurid spectacle
comes into view. It is a forest of the Giant Visnaga,
greenish monsters of the desert, appearing to rise out of
the ground in front of us, towering on their fantastic yellow-green
bodies and leaning toward us, like some strange messengers
of a departed world come back to us in this graveyard
of the desert. The Giant Barrel is the cactus in search
of which we have traveled all the way from Southern California
to San Luis Potos&iacute;, in Central Mexico, a monster
growth six to nine feet tall, three to four feet in diameter,
weighing over four thousand pounds; and estimated by
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
scientists to attain the age of a thousand years! One of
these Giant Bisnaga has been growing in the University of
Arizona gardens for thirty-five years, is only about two feet
tall and eighteen inches through, even after the lapse of a
third of a century. It is in the highlands of San Luis Potos&iacute;
that we have discovered this giant, just as our long hot trek
is drawing to a close. We see that his trunk is single and
unbranched, cylindrical, and greenish or yellow-green. The
four straight sharp stout thorns are all brownish central
spines; no radials are present. The flowers are bright
yellow and showy, and the tops of the plants where they appear
are covered with dense layers of long woolly cream-yellow
hairs. The large blossoms, two and one-half inches
long and as broad, come forth in early June, spreading wide
open in the forenoon and closing in late afternoon.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Whipple&rsquo;s Visnagita</span> (<i>Echinocactus Whipplei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Northern Arizona, Northern Utah, Western Colorado, and New Mexico</i></p>
<p>But one more growth of this strange cactus land must
claim our attention ere the sun completes his journey across
the western skies and the goddess of Evening draws the
mantle of night over the land of the burning sun. It is a
Bisnaga native to the foothills and high mesas of northern
Arizona and Utah, western Colorado, and New Mexico,
but we cannot take the time on this trip to study in northern
parts. Science tells us that Whipple&rsquo;s Visnagita is one of
the smaller of the cactus clan and is generally to be seen
peering out from under other desert shrubs. Little is known
about this very interesting but tiny growth. It is far removed
from all of its near relatives in distribution, and is to
be found as far north as Pleasant Valley near Great Salt Lake
in Utah. The ashy-white thorns are half an inch long or
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
longer, many of them dangerously recurved and hooked;
its large bell-shaped blossoms form a halo of rose and purple
about the tips of this diminutive cactus, quite pretty with
the lavender filaments and reddish styles; the styles are
finely hairy their entire length, a very rare characteristic
among cacti.</p>
<p class="tb">And now the trek of a long desert day is done. Tired
and thirsty, we jot down our notes for future study and
reference, and sit down in the shade of some desert rock or
hummock, to gaze out over the receding panorama before
us, wondering if, after all, it doesn&rsquo;t look like a great desert
graveyard, the big and little Visnaga strangely enigmatic
monuments of some buried past, standing by till Time shall
obliterate all.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Barrel Cactus Group; Visnaga and Visnagita</span> (<i>Echinocactus</i>)</h3>
<h4>How to identify and how they grow</h4>
<p>Small or large plants that are globular or cylindric and
strongly ribbed with sharp stout thorns, suggesting a barrel
in size and shape, from a foot to three or four feet high,
sometimes reaching nine feet, growing singly or in groups of
two to four or more. The central spines are the strongest,
usually one or more hooked; the radial spines also are stout,
the radial bristles or threads if present are somewhat firm
or rather weak in texture. The ridges run lengthwise over
the whole plant body, and are covered with a dense lacework
of thorns which are often cross-ridged and of several kinds,
forming in clusters, a network over the entire plant. This
lacework of spines is rather similar to the network of thorns
covering the Hedgehog Cactus. But the <i>Echinocactus</i> can
be identified by its barrel shape. The stems are mostly simple.
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
There are no leaves nor spicules. The flowers are of
medium size and are borne toward the tips of the plants,
opening in the forenoon and closing in the afternoon of the
same day. The blossoms persist on the mature fruit, which
is shallowly tubercled, and scaly. The <i>Echinocacti</i> have
no spines on the ovaries or fruit, which differentiates them
from the <i>Echinocereus</i> Cacti. The stems of some species
contain a fluid which, though a little saline, is palatable on
the desert.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>The plants are grown from seed sown a quarter- to a half-inch
deep in sandy soil mixed with a small amount of powdered
charcoal and leaf mold in flats or pots, in part shade
and given enough water to keep the soil moist but not wet.
When a half-inch high or so the seedling plants should be
planted in small pots. A south exposure is preferable for
growing these species. They will thrive outside or indoors.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Interlacing Spine Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus intertextus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named from the numerous interlacing or overlapping radial spines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Interlacing Spine Cactus looks very much like a flattened
cylinder, growing from one and one-half to six inches
high and to four inches in diameter. It has thirteen spiral
ribs spaced about three-quarters of an inch apart, obtuse and
sometimes rounded. The ridges of these are dull green
and scurfy. The areolas are very short and crowded close
together. There are from twenty to thirty radial spines,
a half-inch long, which radiate much like the spokes of a
wheel. All these spines are interlocking with one another
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
and incurving. The four central spines do not appear till
after the plant has begun to flower; usually three turn upward
while the other one grows outward. They are a dull
gray suffused with red or brown, or in some instances are
brownish. The flowers form in a cluster at the top of the
plant and are about an inch and a half long, having light purple
sepals and from eighteen to twenty petals, the latter
oblanceolate with a white center that changes to light pink
or purple. The style of the flower is a pale yellow-green
suffused with purple. The fruit is very small and is
covered with scales which are colorless. These plants grow
singly in coarse gravelly or sandy soils at altitudes of four
or five thousand feet, and their blossoms come forth in May.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Set out plants at any season, preferably in the spring, in
sandy or gravelly clay loam in part shade and give some irrigation
monthly to keep the soil moist. They may be
grown from seed in sandy loam in flats with sufficient water
to keep the soil moist. The flats should be in part shade.
The plants grow indoors and out and are not injured by zero
temperatures. In colder climates they can be grown in dry
sunny conservatories or indoor rock gardens.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Purple Spined Visnagita</span> (<i>Echinocactus erectocentrus</i>&mdash;<i>Echinomastus erectocentrus</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named <i>erectocentrus</i> from the erect central spines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The stems of the Purple Spined Visnagita grow singly and
to the height of nine inches, are conical or cylindrical, and
have twenty or more ridges which are spirally arranged.
The areolas are set closely together and are gray-green.
There are as many as sixteen radial spines, less than an inch
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
long, which rotate like the spokes of a wheel. The central
spines, of which there are only one or two, are less than
one inch long and erect. All of the spines have thickened
bases, are a dull light rose-purple, and are covered with a
fine gray scurf. The flowers form at the tops of the stems
and are about two inches in length and breadth, white suffused
with pink or lavender, and have a delicate fragrance.
The flower is composed of twenty petals which are oblanceolate.
The fruit is quite small, less than an inch, and is
oblong, yellowish green, thin-walled; it dries very soon after
maturity in June. These plants thrive best in rocky or
limestone ridges and slopes. They are a handsome species,
and are easily seen in the distance when coming into blossom
in April and May.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Transplant early in spring in rocky or gravelly soil, using
care not to injure the roots and watering monthly to keep
the soil moist. The seeds grow readily if planted in May
or June in sandy loam in flats in part shade with enough water
to keep the soil slightly moist. The plants grow indoors
and out and are not injured by zero temperatures.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Traveler&rsquo;s Friend; Traveler&rsquo;s Compass</span> (<i>Echinocactus Covillei</i>&mdash;<i>Ferocactus Covillei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. F. V. Coville, curator of the National Herbarium, Washington, D. C.)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Traveler&rsquo;s Compass has a peculiarity which helps to
identify it, usually leaning toward the southwest, and this
gives it the common name. The plants grow as solitary
stems to the height of about five feet and the diameter of a
foot and a half. The plants are globose when young, gradually
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
becoming cylindrical and having as many as thirty ribs,
two inches high and three inches apart. The rib crests are
obtuse and are constricted between the areolas. There are
from six to eight radial spines, an inch or two long, which
are stout and straight with cross ridges, and spreading.
They are gray, or dull red and pink, with the tips a translucent
yellow. The central spines are much stronger than the radials,
as long as three inches, extending outward and not
hooked; but the tips are curved. The flowers, which are
bell-shaped, are about three inches long and have forty petals
and twenty sepals. The petals have acute tips and are oblanceolate.
The colors vary from yellow to crimson and
red shadings with the margins of a lighter red. The fruit
is elliptical, about two inches long and a dull yellow.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Transplant in sandy gravelly or rocky soil at any season,
with enough water to keep the soil moist during the growing
season. Plants grow easily from seed in flats in sandy loam
with part shade, watered occasionally to keep the soil
slightly moist. The plants grow inside and outdoors and
are not injured by temperatures twenty-five degrees below
freezing; in colder weather they should be protected.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Turk&rsquo;s Head</span> (<i>Echinocactus horizonthalonius</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(The specific name <i>horizonthalonius</i> is of unknown origin but no doubt refers to the position of the spines)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Turk&rsquo;s Head has as many as eight radial spines, three
to five of which grow directly upward and two to four extend
laterally. Many of them grow to one and one-half
inches long. The central spines are much stouter and longer,
extending outward, also, and downward, about two inches
in length. All the thorns are quite stout, are strongly cross-ridged
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
and curved, and in many instances are twisted. Near
the lower ends they are grayish and tone off to a dull brown
at the tips. This plant is of the solitary-stem variety and
grows to about one foot high and six inches or less in diameter.
It is cylindrical and usually is found with eight spiral
ridges less than an inch high and two inches apart, which are
rounded and light gray or light blue-green. The areolas are
rather well crowded together. The flowers are about two
inches long and have a delicate deep pink to rose-pink coloring,
opening only in the bright sunshine and for just one day.
The flower is composed of thirty-eight spatulate petals and
fourteen sepals. The style is a bright pink. The fruit is
oblong and has a dense woolly growth of long cream-white
hairs; when ripe it is red. These plants grow well in the
arid rocky or stony soils of the open desert and foothills,
never in great abundance.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Set plants in the spring in gravelly or stony soil in sunny
locations with good drainage, and give enough irrigation
to retain the moisture in the soil during the growing season.
Plants grow readily from seed in pots or flats in sandy loam,
in part shade, with enough water to keep the soil lightly moist.
The plants grow outside and inside and are not injured by a
temperature of twenty-five degrees below freezing.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Fishhook Cactus; Candy Barrel Cactus</span> (<i>Echinocactus Wislizeni</i>&mdash;<i>Ferocactus Wislizeni</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. A. Wislizenus, who was in charge of a botanical expedition to the Southwest in 1848)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Candy Barrel Cactus is a very fine plant which grows
as high as seven feet and has twenty to thirty ridges running
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
lengthwise. The lower half of the areola is fringed with a
dozen or so threadlike bristles about two inches long. Along
the ridges are grouped the spines, and in each group it will
be noticed that the lowest spine is the longest and has a good
strong hook at the tip. The four to eight radials are cross-ridged
and stout, one or two inches long. The centrals are
from three to five inches long. The upper spine is quite
erect, and the central pair no more than two inches long.
All the spines are light pink or gray-pink with translucent tips.
The flowers are from two to three inches long and half as
wide, and have forty or more petals and twenty sepals, the
colors being yellow to orange-red. They are formed in a
circle at the top of the plant, blooming from July to September.
The fruit is elliptical, yellowish, and covered with
fan-shaped scales. The plants grow best in sandy or gravelly
clay loam of desert areas and the <i>bajadas</i> and foothills.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Transplant at any season in sandy or gravelly clay loam,
give enough water to keep the soil moist during the growing
season. The seed grow readily in sandy loam in pots or
flats, planted in May or June, in part shade with just enough
water to keep the soil lightly moist. The plants grow indoors
and out and are not injured at twenty-five degrees below
freezing, but in zero weather they require some protection.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Nigger Head</span> (<i>Echinocactus Le Contei</i>&mdash;<i>Ferocactus Le Contei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Dr. John Lawrence Le Conte, who discovered it on the lower Gila River in Arizona)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Nigger Head Cactus has spines or bristles which interlock
and form an impenetrable coat. The plant grows from
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
a single stalk or stem, a foot and a half in diameter, as high
as seven feet, and with twenty to twenty-four ridges. The
ten to fourteen grouped bristles are placed radially, are
about two inches long and are white or mottled much like
a negro&rsquo;s fuzzy hair. There are also from nine to twelve
radial spines one and one-half inches long, while the three
or four centrals are larger and stouter than the others, about
two and one-half inches long. All the central and radial
spines are cross-ridged in mottled pink or light rose shadings,
and have yellow tips. The flowers, which open in April and
May, are yellow, and the midribs of the petals and sepals
are a reddish purple on the outside. The blossoms are about
the length and breadth of an egg and very rarely open in full.
The fruit matures in July. This species grows best in rocky
soils and in the hottest and dryest exposures.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Set out plants preferably early in spring in gravelly or
rocky clay loam with good drainage and sunny exposures, giving
just enough irrigation to keep the soil moist during the
growing season. Plants grow easily from seed in sandy

<h3><span class="sc">Pink Flowered Visnagita</span> (<i>Echinocactus Johnsonii</i>&mdash;<i>Ferocactus Johnsonii</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Joseph Ellis Johnson, an amateur botanist of southern Utah)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>The Pink Flowered Visnagita grows from single cylindrical
stems one foot tall or less and three to four inches in
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
diameter, with its ribs of pale green well hidden by the dense
layer of interlaced spines which are so prevalent in the
<i>Ferocactus</i> group. These dense spines are a gray rose-purple,
or a light yellow. The bell-shaped flowers are about three
inches long and are composed of quite small oblong petals,
deep pink or red. This blending of colors in blossoms and
spines gives the plant a very pleasing appearance. It grows
best in sandy or gravelly soils and sunny exposures.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Plant this Visnagita in sandy or gravelly soil, preferably
early in spring in sunny exposures, water enough to keep
the soil moist during the growing period. Sow the seed in
May or June in a sandy loam in flats or pots with part shade,

<span class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
are quite narrow, a little less than three inches in length,
and covered with a dense layer of cream-yellow hairs. These
great plants grow singly on the highlands of San Luis Potos&iacute;,
Central Mexico, and often attain an age of a thousand years
and a weight of over five thousand pounds.</p>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>This rare cactus grows very slowly. It thrives in sandy
or gravelly clay loam with sunny exposures, and with occasional
irrigation to moisten the soil during dry periods and
during the growing season. The plants will grow out of
doors or indoors and are not injured by a temperature twenty-five
degrees below freezing; from zero weather they should
be given protection.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">Whipple&rsquo;s Visnagita</span> (<i>Echinocactus Whipplei</i>&mdash;<i>Sclerocactus Whipplei</i>)</h3>
<p class="center">(Named in honor of Lieutenant A. W. Whipple, in charge of the Whipple Expedition in 1853-1854, when this plant was discovered)</p>
<h4>How to identify and how it grows</h4>
<p>This little cactus grows only three to six inches tall, and
about the same in diameter, singly or occasionally in clumps.
It is generally to be seen growing in the protection of shrubs
at about five thousand feet. The stem is lined with thirteen
to fifteen prominent spiraled ribs, and seven to eleven white
radial spines. There are also four black and white central
thorns which turn red and finally ash-colored, and the lowest
of these spines is sharply hooked. The flowers cluster at the
top of the plant, bell-shaped blossoms purplish or rose-tinged,
with a reddish style hairy its full length. The reddish
fruit is oblong and has colorless scales, each of which
bears a tuft of hairs in the axil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h4>How to grow</h4>
<p>Transplant at almost any season but preferably in spring
in clay loam or clay soil with part shade, and give enough
water to keep the soil moist. Plants can be grown easily
from seed sown in sandy loam in pots or flats with part shade,
and watered enough to retain moisture in the soil. This
Visnagita grows outdoors or inside and endures a temperature
of twenty degrees below zero; hence it can be grown in
cactus gardens throughout a large part of our country.</p>

<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER VIII
<br />CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Finis cannot be written to any story which deals with the
desert; for the desert call is a charm, it will etch away the
heart of you until it brings you back; back to the long trek
across burning arid wastes where you wondered first how
any living thing could exist and where you <i>found</i> life and
beauty and music, back to the giant amphitheater of the desert
where the moonbeams flit about at night among the weird
Fantastic Clan and the sun boils everything up by day, defying
you then to tarry long. But you take the dare and come
again if you can, and yet again, wending your way farther
each time across the foothills and mountains, ever in search
of that evanescent something called the desert-spell or the
thing that calls you back.</p>
<p>In our domestic lives we work hard for the few little
things we have; many homes are devoid of the animation and
color and the thrill of flower creations; for to have the
beauty of plants and blossoms is to work for them and then
to keep them, by dint of much effort and labor of love. But
how different it is on the desert! There the flowers just
grow and blossom and keep on blooming without care or cultivation
from the hand of man. It seems never to rain in
that great natural amphitheater of the sun, but the plants
Nature has placed there, so carelessly, we fancy, just bloom
and thrive and bloom again. Yet there is no confusion in
their placement and pattern; they are filigree and patchwork,
scroll and lacework; they represent all that is beautiful and
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
symmetrical in Nature&rsquo;s handiwork in this realm of desert
bloom.</p>
<p>Man comes and goes through life, dancing in and out of
the Great Scheme, but he has missed much of the picture and
the skein of life if he has not gone out to see the desert. For
it is there on the broad high mesas of these vast arid stretches
that life begins and ends; it is this desert land of plants and
flowers, the great dry region of the earth, that haunts us,
fascinates us, beckons us, allures us, just as it did the ancient
pueblo and cave dweller, in ages long gone by.</p>
<p>We have finished our long trip into the mysterious realm
of the Fantastic Clan, and we hope that you have gone with
us in fancy along all the devious and rocky paths into the
habitats of the cactus plants, and sensed something of their
strange and matchless growth, and much of their beauty
and charm. For you have not seen Life in all its many and
varied forms till you have viewed at least once the wondrous
parade of the brilliant cactus flowers, and surveyed the gorgeous
painted canvas flung far out over the burning mesas on
the Great American Desert. And remember, too, the words
of the poet:</p>
